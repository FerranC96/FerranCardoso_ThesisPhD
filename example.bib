	abstract = {Organoids are biomimetic tissue models comprising multiple cell types and cell states. Post-translational modification (PTM) signaling networks control cellular phenotypes and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. Although signaling networks vary across cell types, there are limited techniques to study cell type–specific PTMs in heterocellular organoids. Here, we present a multiplexed mass cytometry (MC) protocol for single-cell analysis of PTM signaling and cell states in organoids and organoids co-cultured with fibroblasts and leukocytes. We describe how thiol-reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) enables 35-plex and 126-plex single-cell comparison of organoid cultures and provide a cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) signaling analysis pipeline (CyGNAL) for computing cell type–specific PTM signaling networks. The TOBis MC protocol takes {\textasciitilde}3 d from organoid fixation to data acquisition and can generate single-cell data for {\textgreater}40 antibodies from millions of cells across 126 organoid cultures in a single MC run.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells are regulated by oncogenic mutations and microenvironmental signals, yet these processes are often studied separately. To functionally map how cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cues co-regulate cell-fate in colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed a systematic single-cell analysis of 1,071 colonic organoid cultures regulated by 1) CRC oncogenic mutations, 2) microenvironmental fibroblasts and macrophages, 3) stromal ligands, and 4) signalling inhibitors. Multiplexed single-cell analysis revealed a stepwise epithelial differentiation landscape dictated by combinations of oncogenes and stromal ligands, spanning from fibroblast-induced Clusterin (CLU)+ revival colonic stem cells (revCSC) to oncogene-driven LRIG1+ hyper-proliferative CSC (proCSC). The transition from revCSC to proCSC is regulated by decreasing WNT3A and TGF-β-driven YAP signalling and increasing KRASG12D or stromal EGF/Epiregulin-activated MAPK/PI3K flux. We find APC-loss and KRASG12D collaboratively limit access to revCSC and disrupt stromal-epithelial communication – trapping epithelia in the proCSC fate. These results reveal that oncogenic mutations dominate homeostatic differentiation by obstructing cell-extrinsic regulation of cell-fate plasticity.

	abstract = {We recently described a low-affinity second-generation CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CAT that showed enhanced expansion, cytotoxicity, and antitumor efficacy compared with the high-affinity (FMC63-based) CAR used in tisagenlecleucel, in preclinical models. Furthermore, CAT demonstrated an excellent toxicity profile, enhanced in vivo expansion, and long-term persistence in a phase 1 clinical study. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind these properties of CAT CAR T cells, we performed a systematic in vitro characterization of the transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) and protein (cytometry by time of flight) changes occurring in T cells expressing low-affinity vs high-affinity CD19 CARs following stimulation with CD19-expressing cells. Our results show that CAT CAR T cells exhibit enhanced activation to CD19 stimulation and a distinct transcriptomic and protein profile, with increased activation and cytokine polyfunctionality compared with FMC63 CAR T cells. We demonstrate that the enhanced functionality of low-affinity CAT CAR T cells is a consequence of an antigen-dependent priming induced by residual CD19-expressing B cells present in the manufacture.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.},

Therefore, many groups rely on local bioinformatics support to process queries by accessing the resource's programmatic interfaces if they exist. This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time. Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution.},

	abstract = {The growing number of available single cell gene expression datasets from different species creates opportunities to explore evolutionary relationships between cell types across species. Cross-species integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has been particularly informative in this context. However, in order to do so robustly it is essential to have rigorous benchmarking and appropriate guidelines to ensure that integration results truly reflect biology. We benchmarked 28 combinations of gene homology mapping methods and data integration algorithms in a variety of biological settings. We examined the capability of each strategy to perform species-mixing of known homologous cell types and to preserve biological heterogeneity using 9 established metrics. We also developed a new biology conservation metric to address the maintenance of cell type distinguishability. Overall, scANVI, scVI and SeuratV4 methods achieved a balance between species-mixing and biology conservation. For evolutionarily distant species, including in-paralogs was beneficial. SAMap outperformed when integrating whole-body atlases between species with challenging gene homology annotation. We provided our freely available cross-species integration and assessment pipeline to help analyse new data and develop new algorithms.},

	abstract = {Dysregulated cell-cell communication is a hallmark of many disease phenotypes. Due to recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and computational approaches, it is now possible to study intercellular communication on a genome- and tissue-wide scale. However, most current cell-cell communication inference tools have limitations when analyzing data from multiple samples and conditions. Their main limitation is that they do not address inter-sample heterogeneity adequately, which could lead to false inference. This issue is crucial for analyzing human cohort scRNA-seq datasets, complicating the comparison between healthy and diseased subjects.
Therefore, we developed MultiNicheNet (https://github.com/saeyslab/multinichenetr), a novel framework to better analyze cell-cell communication from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data. The main goals of MultiNicheNet are inferring the differentially expressed and active ligand-receptor pairs between conditions of interest and predicting the putative downstream target genes of these pairs. To achieve this goal, MultiNicheNet applies the principles of state-of-the-art differential expression algorithms for multi-sample scRNA-seq data. As a result, users can analyze differential cell-cell communication while adequately addressing inter-sample heterogeneity, handling complex multifactorial experimental designs, and correcting for batch effects and covariates. Moreover, MultiNicheNet uses NicheNet-v2, our new and substantially improved version of NicheNet’s ligand-receptor network and ligand-target prior knowledge model.
We applied MultiNicheNet to patient cohort data of several diseases (breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and lung fibrosis). For these diseases, MultiNicheNet uncovered known and novel aberrant cell-cell signaling processes. We also demonstrated MultiNicheNet’s potential to perform non-trivial analysis tasks, such as studying between- and within-group differences in cell-cell communication dynamics in response to therapy. As a final example, we used MulitNicheNet to elucidate dysregulated intercellular signaling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis while correcting batch effects in integrated atlas data.
Given the anticipated increase in multi-sample scRNA-seq datasets due to technological advancements and extensive atlas-building integration efforts, we expect that MultiNicheNet will be a valuable tool to uncover differences in cell-cell communication between healthy and diseased states.},

We show here that a salient feature of these tumors is the accumulation of hyaluronan (HA) which, along with reduced aPKC levels, predicts poor survival. HA promotes epithelial heterogeneity and the emergence of a tumor fetal metaplastic cell (TFMC) population endowed with invasive cancer features through a network of interactions with activated fibroblasts. TFMCs are sensitive to HA deposition, and their metaplastic markers have prognostic value. We demonstrate that in vivo HA degradation with a clinical dose of hyaluronidase impairs mCRC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis and enables immune checkpoint blockade therapy by promoting the recruitment of B and CD8+ T cells, including a proportion with resident memory features, and by blocking immunosuppression.},

We analyzed 373,058 single-cell transcriptomes from 63 patients, focusing on 49,155 epithelial cells. We identified a pervasive genetic and transcriptomic dichotomy of malignant cells, based on distinct gene expression, DNA copy number and gene regulatory network. We recapitulated these subtypes in bulk transcriptomes from 3,614 patients. The two intrinsic subtypes, iCMS2 and iCMS3, refine CMS. iCMS3 comprises microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) cancers and one-third of microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. iCMS3 MSS cancers are transcriptomically more similar to MSI-H cancers than to other MSS cancers. CMS4 cancers had either iCMS2 or iCMS3 epithelium; the latter had the worst prognosis. We defined the intrinsic epithelial axis of colorectal cancer and propose a refined ‘IMF’ classification with five subtypes, combining intrinsic epithelial subtype (I), microsatellite instability status (M) and fibrosis (F).},

Here, we introduce “weighted-nearest neighbor” analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.},

Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signaling, so we assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. Using combined molecular-morphological analysis, we demonstrate variable expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental signaling disruption and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is represented by position shift along this axis and is influenced by cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and therapeutic selective pressures.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (\&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of \&gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Here, to comprehensively map cell lineages, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and antigen receptor analysis of almost half a million cells from up to 5 anatomical regions in the developing and up to 11 distinct anatomical regions in the healthy paediatric and adult human gut. This reveals the existence of transcriptionally distinct BEST4 epithelial cells throughout the human intestinal tract. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as a function of intestinal tuft cells. We describe neural cell populations in the developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type-specific expression of genes associated with Hirschsprung’s disease. Finally, using a systems approach, we identify key cell players that drive the formation of secondary lymphoid tissue in early human development. We show that these programs are adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the site of inflammation.

We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.},

For the first time, we profile the cells of the human cardiac conduction system, revealing their distinctive repertoire of ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and cell interactions using a custom CellPhoneDB.org module. We show that the sinoatrial node is compartmentalised, with a core of pacemaker cells, fibroblasts and glial cells supporting paracrine glutamatergic signalling. We introduce a druggable target prediction tool, drug2cell, which leverages single-cell profiles and drug-target interactions, providing unexpected mechanistic insights into the chronotropic effects of drugs, including GLP-1 analogues. In the epicardium, we show enrichment of both IgG+ and IgA+ plasma cells forming immune niches which may contribute to infection defence. We define a ventricular myocardial-stress niche enriched for activated fibroblasts and stressed cardiomyocytes, cell states that are expanded in cardiomyopathies.

They provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves performance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets.},

	abstract = {Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for learning from symbolic data such as text and graphs. However, while complex symbolic datasets often exhibit a latent hierarchical structure, state-of-the-art methods typically learn embeddings in Euclidean vector spaces, which do not account for this property. For this purpose, we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincar{\textbackslash}'e ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity. We introduce an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar{\textbackslash}'e embeddings outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies, both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.},

	abstract = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) embed nodes in a graph into Euclidean space, which has been shown to incur a large distortion when embedding real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables embeddings with much smaller distortion. However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature. Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs. We derive GCN operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map Euclidean input features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvature at each layer. Experiments demonstrate that HGCN learns embeddings that preserve hierarchical structure, and leads to improved performance when compared to Euclidean analogs, even with very low dimensional embeddings: compared to state-of-the-art GCNs, HGCN achieves an error reduction of up to 63.1\% in ROC AUC for link prediction and of up to 47.5\% in F1 score for node classification, also improving state-of-the art on the Pubmed dataset.},

Some examples include social networks in computational social sciences, sensor networks in communications, functional networks in brain imaging, regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.},

Applied to single-cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath?s web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug-in, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell?cell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes. OmniPath provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra- and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and ulcerative colitis.},

To better understand plasticity of signaling networks across tissues and developmental stages, we perform a comparative analysis of signaling networks between macrophages and endothelial cells across human adult and fetal tissues.

Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact:  mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods’ predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide LIANA, a LIgand-receptor ANalysis frAmework as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods.},

Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment.

In this work, we propose a computational tool to quantify pluripotency from single cell transcriptomics data. This approach uses the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with the differentiation process as a scaffold and the gene expression matrix to calculate a score that we call differentiation activity. This score reflects how active the differentiation network is in each cell. We benchmark the performance of our algorithm with two previously published tools, LandSCENT (Chen et al., 2019) and CytoTRACE (Gulati et al., 2020), for four healthy human data sets: breast, colon, hematopoietic and lung. We show that our algorithm is more efficient than LandSCENT and requires less RAM memory than the other programs. We also illustrate a complete workflow from the count matrix to trajectory inference using the breast data set.•ORIGINS is a methodology to quantify pluripotency from scRNA-seq data implemented as a freely available R package.•ORIGINS uses the protein-protein interaction network associated with differentiation and the data set expression matrix to calculate a score (differentiation activity) that quantifies pluripotency for each cell.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

	abstract = {Comparing molecular features, including the identification of genes with differential expression (DE) between conditions, is a powerful approach for characterising disease-specific phenotypes. When testing for DE in single-cell RNA sequencing data, current pipelines first assign cells into discrete clusters (or cell types), followed by testing for differences within each cluster. Consequently, the sensitivity and specificity of DE testing are limited and ultimately dictated by the granularity of the cell type annotation, with discrete clustering being especially suboptimal for continuous trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we present miloDE - a cluster-free framework for differential expression testing. We build on the Milo approach, introduced for differential cell abundance testing, which leverages the graph representation of single-cell data to assign relatively homogenous, ‘neighbouring’ cells into overlapping neighbourhoods. We address key differences between differential abundance and expression testing at the level of neighbourhood assignment, statistical testing, and multiple testing correction. To illustrate the performance of miloDE we use both simulations and real data, in the latter case identifying a transient haemogenic endothelia-like state in chimeric mouse embryos lacking Tal1 as well as uncovering distinct transcriptional programs that characterise changes in macrophages in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. miloDE is available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloDE.},

However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible, so computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA encodes and learns transcriptional drug responses across different cell type, dose, and drug combinations. The model produces easy-to-interpret embeddings for drugs and cell types, which enables drug similarity analysis and predictions for unseen dosage and drug combinations. We show that CPA accurately models single-cell perturbations across compounds, doses, species, and time. We further demonstrate that CPA predicts combinatorial genetic interactions of several types, implying that it captures features that distinguish different interaction programs. Finally, we demonstrate that CPA can generate in-silico 5,329 missing genetic combination perturbations (97.6\% of all possibilities) with diverse genetic interactions. We envision our model will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in-silico response prediction at the single-cell level, and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single-cell technologies.},

Models that generalize well beyond training data can be used to identify combinatorial perturbations of potential therapeutic interest. Major challenges for machine learning on large biological datasets are to find global optima in a complex multidimensional space and mechanistically interpret the solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines explicit mathematical models of cell dynamics with a machine-learning framework, implemented in TensorFlow. We tested the modeling framework on a perturbation-response dataset of a melanoma cell line after drug treatments. The models can be efficiently trained to describe cellular behavior accurately. Even though completely data driven and independent of prior knowledge, the resulting de novo network models recapitulate some known interactions. The approach is readily applicable to various kinetic models of cell biology. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model continuous dynamics and non-linear paths that entities can take in these systems. To address this issue, we establish a link between continuous normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport, that allows us to model the expected paths of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution. We present TrajectoryNet, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions to produce dynamic optimal transport. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.},

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain.

The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype.

	abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

	abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {Mass cytometry is a recently introduced technology that utilizes transition element isotope-tagged antibodies for protein detection on a single-cell basis. By circumventing the limitations of emission spectral overlap associated with fluorochromes utilized in traditional flow cytometry, mass cytometry currently allows measurement of up to 40 parameters per cell. Recently, a comprehensive mass cytometry analysis was described for the hematopoietic differentiation program in human bone marrow from a healthy donor. The current study describes approaches to delineate cell cycle stages utilizing 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU) to mark cells in S phase, simultaneously with antibodies against cyclin B1, cyclin A, and phosphorylated histone H3 (S28) that characterize the other cell cycle phases. Protocols were developed in which an antibody against phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) at serines 807 and 811 was used to separate cells in G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. This mass cytometry method yielded cell cycle distributions of both normal and cancer cell populations that were equivalent to those obtained by traditional fluorescence cytometry techniques. We applied this to map the cell cycle phases of cells spanning the hematopoietic hierarchy in healthy human bone marrow as a prelude to later studies with cancers and other disorders of this lineage. © 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Cell phenotypes (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) exhibit dramatic heterogeneity between and within the different cell types and states underlying cellular functional diversity. Cell genotypes can also display heterogeneity throughout an organism, in the form of somatic genetic variation—most notably in the emergence and evolution of tumors. Recent technical advances in single-cell isolation and the development of omics approaches sensitive enough to reveal these aspects of cell identity have enabled a revolution in the study of multicellular systems. In this review, we discuss the technologies available to resolve the genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of single cells from a wide variety of living systems.},

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces.

Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE .},

In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds arising from each measurement in order to integrate such data and gain an improved picture of the system. We tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, GANs have been utilized to try to find correspondences between sets of samples. However, these GANs are not explicitly designed for proper alignment of manifolds. We present a new GAN called the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together. In our demonstrated examples, cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that the MAGAN successfully aligns them such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other recently proposed models.},

These groups are generally denoted as batches. Systematic differences between these batches not attributable to the biological signal of interest are denoted as batch effects. If ignored when conducting analyses on the combined data, batch effects can lead to distortions in the results. In this paper we present FAbatch, a general, model-based method for correcting for such batch effects in the case of an analysis involving a binary target variable. It is a combination of two commonly used approaches: location-and-scale adjustment and data cleaning by adjustment for distortions due to latent factors. We compare FAbatch extensively to the most commonly applied competitors on the basis of several performance metrics. FAbatch can also be used in the context of prediction modelling to eliminate batch effects from new test data. This important application is illustrated using real and simulated data. We implemented FAbatch and various other functionalities in the R package bapred available online from CRAN.},

Novel computational methods are required to improve the accuracy and robustness of DNA methylation state prediction using Nanopore reads.In this study, we develop DeepSignal, a deep learning method to detect DNA methylation states from Nanopore sequencing reads. Testing on Nanopore reads of Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and pUC19 shows that DeepSignal can achieve higher performance at both read level and genome level on detecting 6 mA and 5mC methylation states comparing to previous hidden Markov model (HMM) based methods. DeepSignal achieves similar performance cross different DNA methylation bases, different DNA methylation motifs and both singleton and mixed DNA CpG. Moreover, DeepSignal requires much lower coverage than those required by HMM and statistics based methods. DeepSignal can achieve 90\% above accuracy for detecting 5mC and 6 mA using only 2× coverage of reads. Furthermore, for DNA CpG methylation state prediction, DeepSignal achieves 90\% correlation with bisulfite sequencing using just 20× coverage of reads, which is much better than HMM based methods. Especially, DeepSignal can predict methylation states of 5\% more DNA CpGs that previously cannot be predicted by bisulfite sequencing. DeepSignal can be a robust and accurate method for detecting methylation states of DNA bases.DeepSignal is publicly available at https://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/deepsignal.Supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {One primary reason that makes single-cell RNA-seq analysis challenging is dropouts, where the data only captures a small fraction of the transcriptome of each cell. Almost all computational algorithms developed for single-cell RNA-seq adopted gene selection, dimension reduction or imputation to address the dropouts. Here, an opposite view is explored. Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal. We represent the dropout pattern by binarizing single-cell RNA-seq count data, and present a co-occurrence clustering algorithm to cluster cells based on the dropout pattern. We demonstrate in multiple published datasets that the binary dropout pattern is as informative as the quantitative expression of highly variable genes for the purpose of identifying cell types. We expect that recognizing the utility of dropouts provides an alternative direction for developing computational algorithms for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.},

We used SPLiT-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. SPLiT-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.},

CyTOF can simultaneously assess DNA content and proteins and has the capacity to measure 40 to 100 parameters in each cell. Applying this technology to tissues or cells on slides, termed imaging mass cytometry (IMC), allows for visualization of normal and diseased tissues in situ. The high-dimensional proteomic analysis that can be undertaken with CyTOF and IMC has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex and heterogeneous developmental and disease pathways. This article will describe the CyTOF experimental workflow, including reagent selection, sample preparation, and data analysis. CyTOF is compared to flow cytometry, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of these powerful techniques.

We tested the methods on three types of samples: cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue, generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To directly compare the methods and avoid processing differences introduced by the existing pipelines, we developed scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used with any single-cell RNA-sequencing method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance, such as the structure and alignment of reads, sensitivity and extent of multiplets, and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples.},

Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that many current single-cell methods do not address, leading to biased inference, highly inflated type 1 error rates, and reduced robustness and reproducibility. This includes methods that use a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within-sample correlation. Here, we document this dependence across a range of cell types and show that pseudo-bulk aggregation methods are conservative and underpowered relative to mixed models. To compute differential expression within a specific cell type across treatment groups, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for individual, to properly account for both zero inflation and the correlation structure among measures from cells within an individual. Finally, we provide power estimates across a range of experimental conditions to assist researchers in designing appropriately powered studies.},

Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse–human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has become essential for biomedical research over the past decade, particularly in developmental biology, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience. Most commercially available scRNA-seq protocols require cells to be recovered intact and viable from tissue. This has precluded many cell types from study and largely destroys the spatial context that could otherwise inform analyses of cell identity and function. An increasing number of commercially available platforms now facilitate spatially resolved, high-dimensional assessment of gene transcription, known as ‘spatial transcriptomics’. Here, we introduce different classes of method, which either record the locations of hybridized mRNA molecules in tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to assessment, or employ spatial arrays of mRNA probes of pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including pre-processing, integration with existing scRNA-seq data, and inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are already improving our understanding of human tissues in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical research.},

Heterogeneous myeloid populations were identified using a novel flow cytometry panel in both tumor and paired non-tumor bowel (NTB) from CRC patients. The frequency of macrophage subsets with a gut-conditioned phenotype was lower in tumor compared with NTB. We used an in vitro system to show that two of the macrophage populations represented pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Conditioned media that contained high levels of interleukin-6 promoted and maintained an anti-inflammatory phenotype in vitro. This study demonstrates the plasticity and heterogeneity of macrophage subtypes in human CRC, and the feasibility of studying complex populations.

	abstract = {Neoplastic cells recruit fibroblasts through various growth factors and cytokines. These “cancer-associated fibroblasts” (CAF) actively interact with neoplastic cells and form a myofibroblastic microenvironment that promotes cancer growth and survival and supports malignancy. Several products of their paracrine signaling repertoire have been recognized as tumor growth and metastasis regulators. However, tumor-promoting cell signaling is not the only reason that makes CAFs key components of the “tumor microenvironment,” as CAFs affect both the architecture and growth mechanics of the developing tumor. CAFs participate in the remodeling of peritumoral stroma, which is a prerequisite of neoplastic cell invasion, expansion, and metastasis. CAFs are not present peritumorally as individual cells but they act orchestrated to fully deploy a desmoplastic program, characterized by “syncytial” (or collective) configuration and altered cell adhesion properties. Such myofibroblastic cohorts are reminiscent of those encountered in wound-healing processes. The view of “cancer as a wound that does not heal” led to useful comparisons between wound healing and tumorigenesis and expanded our knowledge of the role of CAF cohorts in cancer. In this integrative model of cancer invasion and metastasis, we propose that the CAF-supported microenvironment has a dual tumor-promoting role. Not only does it provide essential signals for cancer cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and survival but it also facilitates cancer cell local invasion and metastatic phenomena.

Many new putative markers of intestinal stem cells and their progeny have been described using single-cell transcriptomics, which has contributed to the identification of novel subpopulations of mature cell types and insight into their developmental trajectories. This approach has revealed tremendous cellular heterogeneity within the intestinal epithelium that is concordant with its diverse and multifaceted functions. We discuss the function of these subpopulations during tissue homeostasis, as well as putative subpopulations with inducible regenerative potential following tissue injury.},

	abstract = {Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5-positive (Lgr5+) stem cells reside at crypt bottoms of the small and large intestine. Small intestinal Paneth cells supply Wnt3, EGF, and Notch signals to neighboring Lgr5+ stem cells. Whereas the colon lacks Paneth cells, deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells are intermingled with Lgr5+ stem cells at crypt bottoms. Here, we report regenerating islet-derived family member 4 (Reg4) as a marker of DCS cells. To investigate a niche function, we eliminated DCS cells by using the diphtheria-toxin receptor gene knocked into the murine Reg4 locus. Ablation of DCS cells results in loss of stem cells from colonic crypts and disrupts gut homeostasis and colon organoid growth. In agreement, sorted Reg4+ DCS cells promote organoid formation of single Lgr5+ colon stem cells. DCS cells can be massively produced from Lgr5+ colon stem cells in vitro by combined Notch inhibition and Wnt activation. We conclude that Reg4+ DCS cells serve as Paneth cell equivalents in the colon crypt niche.},

We show that in normal intestinal epithelium, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activity of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are induced at the transition from stem cell to transit-amplifying cell. Induction of ER stress causes loss of stemness in a Perk-eIF2α-dependent manner. Inhibition of Perk-eIF2α signaling results in stem cell accumulation in organoid culture of primary intestinal epithelium.

	abstract = {An imbalance in the correct protein folding milieu of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can cause ER stress, which leads to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR constitutes a highly conserved and intricately regulated group of pathways that serve to restore ER homeostasis through adaptation or apoptosis. Numerous studies over the last decade have shown that the UPR plays a critical role in shaping immunity and inflammation, resulting in the recognition of the UPR as a key player in pathological processes including complex inflammatory, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. The intestinal epithelium, with its many highly secretory cells, forms an important barrier and messenger between the luminal environment and the host immune system. It is not surprising, that numerous studies have associated ER stress and the UPR with intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the roles of ER stress and the UPR in shaping immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, the role played by the UPR in disease, with emphasis on IBD and CRC, is described here. As a key player in immunity and inflammation, the UPR has been increasingly recognized as an important pharmacological target in the development of therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated pathologies. We summarize available strategies targeting the UPR and their therapeutic implications. Understanding the balance between homeostasis and pathophysiology, as well as means of manipulating this balance, provides an important avenue for future research.},

Despite its seemingly simple architecture, the intestinal lining consists of highly distinct cell populations that are continuously renewed by the same stem cell population. The need to maintain balanced diversity of cell types in an unceasingly regenerating tissue demands intricate mechanisms of spatial or temporal cell fate control. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing, spatio-temporal profiling and organoid technology have shed new light on the intricate micro-structure of the intestinal epithelium and on the mechanisms that maintain it. This led to the discovery of unexpected plasticity, zonation along the crypt-villus axis and new mechanism of self-organization. However, not only the epithelium, but also the underlying mesenchyme is distinctly structured. Several new studies have explored the intestinal stroma with single cell resolution and unveiled important interactions with the epithelium that are crucial for intestinal function and regeneration. In this review, we will discuss these recent findings and highlight the technologies that lead to their discovery. We will examine strengths and limitations of each approach and consider the wider impact of these results on our understanding of the intestine in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Background The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. Methods Data on new cancer diagnoses during 2001–2018 were obtained from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries’ Cancer in North America Incidence file, which is comprised of data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded and National Cancer Institute-funded, population-based cancer registry programs. Data on cancer deaths during 2001–2019 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Five-year average incidence and death rates along with trends for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types are reported by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age. Results Overall cancer incidence rates were 497 per 100,000 among males (ranging from 306 among Asian/Pacific Islander males to 544 among Black males) and 431 per 100,000 among females (ranging from 309 among Asian/Pacific Islander females to 473 among American Indian/Alaska Native females) during 2014–2018. The trend during the corresponding period was stable among males and increased 0.2\% on average per year among females, with differing trends by sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, incidence rates increased for three cancers (including pancreas and kidney), were stable for seven cancers (including prostate), and decreased for eight (including lung and larynx) of the 18 most common cancers considered in this analysis. Among females, incidence rates increased for seven cancers (including melanoma, liver, and breast), were stable for four cancers (including uterus), and decreased for seven (including thyroid and ovary) of the 18 most common cancers. Overall cancer death rates decreased by 2.3\% per year among males and by 1.9\% per year among females during 2015–2019, with the sex-specific declining trend reflected in every major racial/ethnic group. During 2015–2019, death rates decreased for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females, with the steepest declines ({\textgreater}4\% per year) reported for lung cancer and melanoma. Five-year survival for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer improved between 2001 and 2018; however, overall incidence (2001–2018) and mortality (2001–2019) continued to increase for this site. Among children (younger than 15 years), recent trends were stable for incidence and decreased for mortality; and among, adolescents and young adults (aged 15–39 years), recent trends increased for incidence and declined for mortality. Conclusions Cancer death rates continued to decline overall, for children, and for adolescents and young adults, and treatment advances have led to accelerated declines in death rates for several sites, such as lung and melanoma. The increases in incidence rates for several common cancers in part reflect changes in risk factors, screening test use, and diagnostic practice. Racial/ethnic differences exist in cancer incidence and mortality, highlighting the need to understand and address inequities. Population-based incidence and mortality data inform prevention, early detection, and treatment efforts to help reduce the cancer burden in the United States.},

	abstract = {In recent years, data-driven inference of cell-cell communication has helped reveal coordinated biological processes across cell types. While multiple cell-cell communication tools exist, results are specific to the tool of choice, due to the diverse assumptions made across computational frameworks. Moreover, tools are often limited to analyzing single samples or to performing pairwise comparisons. As experimental design complexity and sample numbers continue to increase in single-cell datasets, so does the need for generalizable methods to decipher cell-cell communication in such scenarios. Here, we integrate two tools, LIANA and Tensor-cell2cell, which combined can deploy multiple existing methods and resources, to enable the robust and flexible identification of cell-cell communication programs across multiple samples. In this protocol, we show how the integration of our tools facilitates the choice of method to infer cell-cell communication and subsequently perform an unsupervised deconvolution to obtain and summarize biological insights. We explain how to perform the analysis step-by-step in both Python and R, and we provide online tutorials with detailed instructions available at https://ccc-protocols.readthedocs.io/. This protocol typically takes {\textasciitilde}1.5h to complete from installation to downstream visualizations on a GPU-enabled computer, for a dataset of {\textasciitilde}63k cells, 10 cell types, and 12 samples.},

	abstract = {Biology has become a data-intensive science. Recent technological advances in single-cell genomics have enabled the measurement of multiple facets of cellular state, producing datasets with millions of single-cell observations. While these data hold great promise for understanding molecular mechanisms in health and disease, analysis challenges arising from sparsity, technical and biological variability, and high dimensionality of the data hinder the derivation of such mechanistic insights. To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we present the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges associated with running the competition.},

However, the rapidly evolving field of scRNA-seq invoked the emergence of various analytics approaches aimed to maximize the full potential of this novel strategy. Unlike population-based RNA sequencing approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated challenges. Despite the vast number of analytical methods, a universal standardization is lacking. While this reflects the fields’ immaturity, it may also encumber a newcomer to blend in.},

Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse–human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications.},

We sought to define transcriptional states of colorectal cancer cells and signals controlling their development by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of tumors and matched non-cancerous tissues of twelve colorectal cancer patients. We defined patient-overarching colorectal cancer cell clusters characterized by differential activities of oncogenic signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and oncogenic traits such as replication stress. RNA metabolic labeling and assessment of RNA velocity in patient-derived organoids revealed developmental trajectories of colorectal cancer cells organized along a mitogen-activated protein kinase activity gradient. This was in contrast to normal colon organoid cells developing along graded Wnt activity. Experimental targeting of EGFR-BRAF-MEK in cancer organoids affected signaling and gene expression contingent on predictive KRAS/BRAF mutations and induced cell plasticity overriding default developmental trajectories. Our results highlight directional cancer cell development as a driver of non-genetic cancer cell heterogeneity and re-routing of trajectories as a response to targeted therapy.},

Here we present a metric and technique to quantitatively assess the extent to which self-organizing directed networks exhibit a flow hierarchy. Flow hierarchy is a commonly observed but theoretically overlooked form of hierarchy in networks. We show that the ecological, neurobiological, economic, and information processing networks are generally more hierarchical than their comparable random networks. We further discovered that hierarchy degree has increased over the course of the evolution of Linux kernels. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing feature of real-world evolving networks, and the measurement of hierarchy opens the way to understand the structural regimes and evolutionary patterns of self-organizing networks. Our measurement technique makes it possible to objectively compare hierarchies of different networks and of different evolutionary stages of a single network, and compare evolving patterns of different networks. It can be applied to various complex systems, which can be represented as directed networks. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity, 2011},

Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.},

We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate.

	abstract = {Cancer cells are regulated by oncogenic mutations and microenvironmental signals, yet these processes are often studied separately. To functionally map how cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cues co-regulate cell-fate in colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed a systematic single-cell analysis of 1,071 colonic organoid cultures regulated by 1) CRC oncogenic mutations, 2) microenvironmental fibroblasts and macrophages, 3) stromal ligands, and 4) signalling inhibitors. Multiplexed single-cell analysis revealed a stepwise epithelial differentiation landscape dictated by combinations of oncogenes and stromal ligands, spanning from fibroblast-induced Clusterin (CLU)+ revival colonic stem cells (revCSC) to oncogene-driven LRIG1+ hyper-proliferative CSC (proCSC). The transition from revCSC to proCSC is regulated by decreasing WNT3A and TGF-β-driven YAP signalling and increasing KRASG12D or stromal EGF/Epiregulin-activated MAPK/PI3K flux.

	abstract = {Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can model personalized therapy responses, however current screening technologies cannot reveal drug response mechanisms or study how tumor microenvironment cells alter therapeutic performance. To address this, we developed a highly-multiplexed mass cytometry platform to measure post translational modification (PTM) signaling in {\textgreater}2,500 colorectal cancer (CRC) PDOs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in response to clinical therapies at single-cell resolution. To compare patient- and microenvironment-specific drug responses in thousands of single-cell datasets, we developed Trellis — a highly-scalable, hierarchical tree-based treatment effect analysis method. Trellis single-cell screening revealed that on-target cell-cycle blockage and DNA-damage drug effects are common, even in chemorefractory PDOs. However, drug-induced apoptosis is patient-specific. We found drug-induced apoptosis does not correlate with genotype or clinical staging but does align with cell-intrinsic PTM signaling in PDOs. CAFs protect chemosensitive PDOs by shifting cancer cells into a slow-cycling cell-state and CAF chemoprotection can be reversed by inhibiting YAP.

Post-translational modification (PTM) signaling networks control cellular phenotypes and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. Although signaling networks vary across cell types, there are limited techniques to study cell type–specific PTMs in heterocellular organoids. Here, we present a multiplexed mass cytometry (MC) protocol for single-cell analysis of PTM signaling and cell states in organoids and organoids co-cultured with fibroblasts and leukocytes. We describe how thiol-reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) enables 35-plex and 126-plex single-cell comparison of organoid cultures and provide a cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) signaling analysis pipeline (CyGNAL) for computing cell type–specific PTM signaling networks. The TOBis MC protocol takes {\textasciitilde}3 d from organoid fixation to data acquisition and can generate single-cell data for {\textgreater}40 antibodies from millions of cells across 126 organoid cultures in a single MC run.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Estimating differentiation potency of single cells is a task of great biological and clinical significance, as it may allow identification of normal and cancer stem cell phenotypes. However, very few single-cell potency models have been proposed, and their robustness and reliability across independent studies have not yet been fully assessed.Results: Using nine independent single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, we here compare four different single-cell potency models to each other, in their ability to discriminate cells that ought to differ in terms of differentiation potency. Two of the potency models approximate potency via network entropy measures that integrate the single-cell RNA-Seq profile of a cell with a protein interaction network. The comparison between the four models reveals that integration of RNA-Seq data with a protein interaction network dramatically improves the robustness and reliability of single-cell potency estimates. We demonstrate that underlying this robustness is a correlation relationship, according to which high differentiation potency is positively associated with overexpression of network hubs. We further show that overexpressed network hubs are strongly enriched for ribosomal mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that their mRNA levels may provide a universal marker of a cell’s potency. Thus, this study provides novel systems-biological insight into cellular potency and may provide a foundation for improved models of differentiation potency with far-reaching implications for the discovery of novel stem cell or progenitor cell phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Modern single-cell data analysis relies on statistical testing (e.g. differential expression testing) to identify genes or proteins that are up-or down-regulated in relation to cell-types or clinical outcomes. However, existing algorithms for such statistical testing are often limited by technical noise and cellular heterogeneity, which lead to false-positive results. To constrain the analysis to a compact and phenotype-related cell population, differential abundance (DA) testing methods were employed to identify subgroups of cells whose abundance changed significantly in response to disease progression, or experimental perturbation. Despite the effectiveness of DA testing algorithms of identifying critical cell-states, there are no systematic benchmarking or comparative studies to compare their usages in practice. Herein, we performed the first comprehensive benchmarking study to objectively evaluate and compare the benefits and potential downsides of current state-of-the-art DA testing methods. We benchmarked six DA testing methods on several practical tasks, using both synthetic and real single-cell datasets. The task evaluated include, recognizing true DA subpopulations, appropriate handing of batch effects, runtime efficiency, and hyperparameter usability and robustness. Based on various evaluation results, this paper gives dataset-specific suggestions for the usage of DA testing methods.},

With the rapid accumulation of biological network data, GNNs have also become an important tool in bioinformatics. In this research, a systematic survey of GNNs and their advances in bioinformatics is presented from multiple perspectives. We first introduce some commonly used GNN models and their basic principles. Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging. Based on the analysis, we provide an outlook on the shortcomings of current studies and point out their developing prospect. Although GNNs have achieved excellent results in many biological tasks at present, they still face challenges in terms of low-quality data processing, methodology, and interpretability and have a long road ahead. We believe that GNNs are potentially an excellent method that solves various biological problems in bioinformatics research.},

In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

We benchmark CCAT against 8 other single-cell potency models and across 28 scRNA-Seq studies, encompassing over 2 million cells, demonstrating comparable accuracy than the current state-of-the-art, at a significantly reduced computational cost, and with increased robustness to dropouts.CCAT is part of the SCENT R-package, freely available from https://github.com/aet21/SCENT.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we reveal a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the biosynthetic capacities of CRC cells. We discover that the majority of ribosomal DNA transcription and protein synthesis in CRCs occurs in a limited subset of tumor cells that localize in defined niches. The rest of the tumor cells undergo an irreversible loss of their biosynthetic capacities as a consequence of differentiation. Cancer cells within the biosynthetic domains are characterized by elevated levels of the RNA polymerase I subunit A (POLR1A). Genetic ablation of POLR1A-high cell population imposes an irreversible growth arrest on CRCs. We show that elevated biosynthesis defines stemness in both LGR5+ and LGR5− tumor cells. Therefore, a common architecture in CRCs is a simple cell hierarchy based on the differential capacity to transcribe ribosomal DNA and synthesize proteins.},

We identify somatic drivers among Hippo genes and the related microRNA (miRNA) regulators, and using functional genomic approaches, we experimentally characterize YAP and TAZ mutation effects and miR-590 and miR-200a regulation for TAZ. Hippo pathway activity is best characterized by a YAP/TAZ transcriptional target signature of 22 genes, which shows robust prognostic power across cancer types. Our elastic-net integrated modeling further reveals cancer-type-specific pathway regulators and associated cancer drivers. Our results highlight the importance of Hippo signaling in squamous cell cancers, characterized by frequent amplification of YAP/TAZ, high expression heterogeneity, and significant prognostic patterns.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2208.08561},
	abstract = {The scattering transform is a multilayered, wavelet-based transform initially introduced as a model of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has played a foundational role in our understanding of these networks' stability and invariance properties. Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in extending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such as graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep learning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in this new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering transform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary. In this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering on measure spaces. Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric scattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as directed graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new criterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be invariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the scattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties. Additionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly sampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a data-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform approximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold. Moreover, we use a diffusion-maps based approach to prove quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence of one of these approximations as the number of sample points tends to infinity. Lastly, we showcase the utility of our method on spherical images, directed graphs, and on high-dimensional single-cell data.},

	abstract = {Summary Recent years have seen the release of several toolsets that reveal cell-cell interactions from single-cell data. However, all existing approaches leverage mean celltype gene expression values, and do not preserve the single-cell fidelity of the original data. Here, we present NICHES (Niche Interactions and Communication Heterogeneity in Extracellular Signaling), a tool to explore extracellular signaling at the truly single-cell level. NICHES allows embedding of ligand-receptor signal proxies to visualize heterogeneous signaling archetypes within cell clusters, between cell clusters, and across experimental conditions. When applied to spatial transcriptomic data, NICHES can be used to reflect local cellular microenvironment. NICHES can operate with any list of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms and is compatible with existing single-cell packages and pseudotime techniques. NICHES is also a user friendly and extensible program, allowing rapid analysis of cell-cell signaling at single-cell resolution.

	abstract = {Single cell genomics is a powerful tool to distinguish altered cell states in disease tissue samples, through joint analysis with healthy reference datasets. Collections of data from healthy individuals are being integrated in cell atlases that provide a comprehensive view of cellular phenotypes in a tissue. However, it remains unclear whether atlas datasets are suitable references for disease-state identification, or whether matched control samples should be employed, to minimise false discoveries driven by biological and technical confounders. Here we quantitatively compare the use of atlas and control datasets as references for identification of disease-associated cell states, on simulations and real disease scRNA-seq datasets. We find that reliance on a single type of reference dataset introduces false positives. Conversely, using an atlas dataset as reference for latent space learning followed by differential analysis against a matched control dataset leads to precise identification of disease-associated cell states. We show that, when an atlas dataset is available, it is possible to reduce the number of control samples without increasing the rate of false discoveries. Using a cell atlas of blood cells from 12 studies to contextualise data from a case-control COVID-19 cohort, we sensitively detect cell states associated with infection, and distinguish heterogeneous pathological cell states associated with distinct clinical severities. Our analysis provides guiding principles for design of disease cohort studies and efficient use of cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

	abstract = {Around 30–40\% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergoing curative resection of the primary tumour will develop metastases in the subsequent years1. Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5+ stem-like tumour cells2–4, and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1high cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to show that many of the tools of signal processing, adapted Fourier and wavelet analysis can be naturally lifted to the setting of digital data clouds, graphs, and manifolds. We use diffusion as a smoothing and scaling tool to enable coarse graining and multiscale analysis. Given a diffusion operator T on a manifold or a graph, with large powers of low rank, we present a general multiresolution construction for efficiently computing, representing and compressing Tt. This allows a direct multiscale computation, to high precision, of functions of the operator, notably the associated Green's function, in compressed form, and their fast application. Classes of operators for which these computations are fast include certain diffusion-like operators, in any dimension, on manifolds, graphs, and in non-homogeneous media. We use ideas related to the Fast Multipole Methods and to the wavelet analysis of Calderón–Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, to numerically enforce the emergence of a natural hierarchical coarse graining of a manifold, graph or data set. For example for a body of text documents the construction leads to a directory structure at different levels of generalization. The dyadic powers of an operator can be used to induce a multiresolution analysis, as in classical Littlewood–Paley and wavelet theory: we construct, with efficient and stable algorithms, bases of orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets associated to this multiresolution analysis, together with the corresponding downsampling operators, and use them to compress the corresponding powers of the operator. While most of our discussion deals with symmetric operators and relates to localization to spectral bands, the symmetry of the operators and their spectral theory need not be considered, as the main assumption is reduction of the numerical ranks as we take powers of the operator.},

	abstract = {We propose a new fast method of measuring distances between large numbers of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(n)\$ time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.},

The engraftment procedure takes less than 5 minutes, shows efficient tumor engraftment in 2/3 mice, and can be achieved using organoids derived from GEMMs, wild type organoids engineered ex vivo, or from patient-derived human CRC organoids. In this model, we describe the genotype and time-dependent progression of CRCs from adenocarcinoma (6 weeks), to local disseminated disease (11–12 weeks) and spontaneous metastasis ({\textgreater}20 weeks). Further, we use the system to show that loss of dysregulated Wnt signaling is critical for the progression of disseminated CRCs.

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium fulfils pleiotropic functions in nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and immune surveillance while also forming a barrier against luminal toxins and gut-resident microbiota. Incessantly barraged by extraneous stresses, the intestine must continuously replenish its epithelial lining and regenerate the full gamut of specialized cell types that underpin its functions. Homeostatic remodelling is orchestrated by the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche: a convergence of epithelial- and stromal-derived cues, which maintains ISCs in a multipotent state. Following demise of homeostatic ISCs post injury, plasticity is pervasive among multiple populations of reserve stem-like cells, lineage-committed progenitors, and/or fully differentiated cell types, all of which can contribute to regeneration and repair. Failure to restore the epithelial barrier risks seepage of toxic luminal contents, resulting in inflammation and likely predisposing to tumour formation. Here, we explore how homeostatic niche-signalling pathways are subverted in tumorigenesis, enabling ISCs to gain autonomy from niche restraints (“ISC emancipation”) and transform into cancer stem cells capable of driving tumour initiation, progression, and therapy resistance. We further consider the implications of the pervasive plasticity of the intestinal epithelium for the trajectory of colorectal cancer, the emergence of distinct molecular subtypes, the propensity to metastasize, and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {The turnover of the intestinal epithelium is driven by multipotent LGR5+ crypt-base columnar cells (CBCs) located at the bottom of crypt zones1. However, CBCs are lost following injury, such as irradiation2, but the intestinal epithelium is nevertheless able to recover3. Thus, a second population of quiescent ‘+4’ cells, or reserve stem cells (RSCs), has previously been proposed to regenerate the damaged intestine4–7. Although CBCs and RSCs were thought to be mutually exclusive4,8, subsequent studies have found that LGR5+ CBCs express RSC markers9 and that RSCs were dispensable—whereas LGR5+ cells were essential—for repair of the damaged intestine3. In addition, progenitors of absorptive enterocytes10, secretory cells11–15 and slow cycling LGR5+ cells16 have been shown to contribute to regeneration whereas the transcriptional regulator YAP1, which is important for intestinal regeneration, was suggested to induce a pro-survival phenotype in LGR5+ cells17. Thus, whether cellular plasticity or distinct cell populations are critical for intestinal regeneration remains unknown. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the regenerating mouse intestine and identified a distinct, damage-induced quiescent cell type that we term the revival stem cell (revSC). revSCs are marked by high clusterin expression and are extremely rare under homoeostatic conditions, yet give rise—in a temporal hierarchy—to all the major cell types of the intestine, including LGR5+ CBCs. After intestinal damage by irradiation, targeted ablation of LGR5+ CBCs, or treatment with dextran sodium sulfate, revSCs undergo a YAP1-dependent transient expansion, reconstitute the LGR5+ CBC compartment and are required to regenerate a functional intestine. These studies thus define a unique stem cell that is mobilized by damage to revive the homoeostatic stem cell compartment and regenerate the intestinal epithelium.},

Here we demonstrate, using over 7,000 single-cell RNA-Seq profiles, that differentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signalling promiscuity, or entropy, of a cell’s transcriptome in the context of an interaction network, without the need for feature selection. We show that signalling entropy provides a more accurate and robust potency estimate than other entropy-based measures, driven in part by a subtle positive correlation between the transcriptome and connectome. Signalling entropy identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency and drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those derived from circulating tumour cells. It further reveals that expression heterogeneity within single-cell populations is regulated. In summary, signalling entropy allows in silico estimation of the differentiation potency and plasticity of single cells and bulk samples, providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem-cell phenotypes.},

In this process, sequential mutations of APC/Wnt, KRAS, TP53 and SMAD4 stepwisely enable an oncogenic signalling network. Here, we developed a novel mass cytometry antibody panel to analyse colorectal cancer cell differentiation and signalling in human isogenic colorectal cancer organoids and in patient-derived cultures. We define a differentiation axis following EphrinB2 abundance in all tumour progression states from normal to cancer. We show that during colorectal cancer progression, oncogenes decrease dependence on external factors and shape distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell-promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the signalling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of oncogenic signals. Our work underscores the key role of cell plasticity as a hallmark of cancer that is gradually unlocked during colorectal cancer progression.},

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a tissue with high cell turnover, supported by adult intestinal stem cells. Intestinal homeostasis is underpinned by crypt basal columnar stem cells, marked by expression of the LGR5 gene. However, recent research has demonstrated considerable stem cell plasticity following injury, with de-differentiation of a range of other intestinal cell populations, induced by a permissive microenvironment in the regenerating mucosa. The regulation of this profound adaptive cell reprogramming response is the subject of current research. There is a demonstrable contribution from disruption of key homeostatic signalling pathways such as Wnt and BMP, and an emerging signalling hub role for the mechanoreceptor transducers YAP/TAZ, negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway. However, a number of outstanding questions remain, including a need to understand how tissues sense damage, and how pathways intersect to mediate dynamic changes in the stem cell population. Better understanding of these pathways, associated functional redundancies, and how they may be both enhanced for recovery of inflammatory diseases, and co-opted in neoplasia development, may have significant clinical implications, and could lead to development of more targeted molecular therapies which target individual stem or stem-like cell populations.

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the Gene Mover's Distance, a measure of similarity between a pair of cells based on their gene expression profiles obtained via single-cell RNA sequencing. The underlying idea of the proposed distance is to interpret the gene expression array of a single cell as a discrete probability measure. The distance between two cells is hence computed by solving an Optimal Transport problem between the two corresponding discrete measures. In the Optimal Transport model, we use two types of cost function for measuring the distance between a pair of genes. The first cost function exploits a gene embedding, called gene2vec, which is used to map each gene to a high dimensional vector: the cost of moving a unit of mass of gene expression from a gene to another is set to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding embedded vectors. The second cost function is based on a Pearson distance among pairs of genes. In both cost functions, the more two genes are correlated, the lower is their distance. We exploit the Gene Mover's Distance to solve two classification problems: the classification of cells according to their condition and according to their type. To assess the impact of our new metric, we compare the performances of a \$k\$-Nearest Neighbor classifier using different distances. The computational results show that the Gene Mover's Distance is competitive with the state-of-the-art distances used in the literature.},

OT defines distances to compare high-dimensional data represented as probability distributions. To speed up computations and cope with the high dimensionality of single-cell data, we consider the entropic regularization of the classical OT distance. We then extensively benchmark OT against state-of-the-art metrics over 13 independent datasets, including simulated, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. First, we test the ability of the metrics to detect the similarity between cells belonging to the same groups (e.g. cell types, cell lines of origin). Then, we apply unsupervised clustering and test the quality of the resulting clusters. OT is found to improve cell–cell similarity inference and cell clustering in all simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as well as in scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data.All our analyses are reproducible through the OT-scOmics Jupyter notebook available at https://github.com/ComputationalSystemsBiology/OT-scOmics.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {In modern relational machine learning it is common to encounter large graphs that arise via interactions or similarities between observations in many domains. Further, in many cases the target entities for analysis are actually signals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of graph signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost over the underlying graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the cost of transporting one probability distribution to another over an underlying metric space. However, this is inefficient when computing the EMD between many signals. Here, we propose an unbalanced graph EMD that efficiently embeds the unbalanced EMD on an underlying graph into an \$L{\textasciicircum}1\$ space, whose metric we call unbalanced diffusion earth mover's distance (UDEMD). Next, we show how this gives distances between graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we apply this to organizing patients based on clinical notes, embedding cells modeled as signals on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals over a large cell graph. In each case, we show that UDEMD-based embeddings find accurate distances that are highly efficient compared to other methods.},

Here, we introduce AWARE, a graph neural message passing approach to inject cellular and tissue context into protein embeddings. AWARE optimizes for a multi-scale embedding space, whose structure reflects network topology at a single-cell resolution. We construct a multi-scale network of the Human Cell Atlas and apply AWARE to learn protein, cell type, and tissue embeddings that uphold cell type and tissue hierarchies. We demonstrate AWARE's utility on the novel task of predicting whether a protein is altered in disease and where that association most likely manifests in the human body. To this end, AWARE outperforms generic embeddings without contextual information by at least 12.5\%, showing AWARE's potential to reveal context-dependent roles of proteins in disease.},

	abstract = {Complex biological systems are traditionally modelled as graphs of interconnected biological entities. These graphs, i.e. biological knowledge graphs, are then processed using graph exploratory approaches to perform different types of analytical and predictive tasks. Despite the high predictive accuracy of these approaches, they have limited scalability due to their dependency on time-consuming path exploratory procedures. In recent years, owing to the rapid advances of computational technologies, new approaches for modelling graphs and mining them with high accuracy and scalability have emerged. These approaches, i.e. knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, operate by learning low-rank vector representations of graph nodes and edges that preserve the graph’s inherent structure. These approaches were used to analyse knowledge graphs from different domains where they showed superior performance and accuracy compared to previous graph exploratory approaches. In this work, we study this class of models in the context of biological knowledge graphs and their different applications. We then show how KGE models can be a natural fit for representing complex biological knowledge modelled as graphs. We also discuss their predictive and analytical capabilities in different biology applications. In this regard, we present two example case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of KGE models: prediction of drug–target interactions and polypharmacy side effects. Finally, we analyse different practical considerations for KGEs, and we discuss possible opportunities and challenges related to adopting them for modelling biological systems.},

	abstract = {The development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to characterize the cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes at single-cell resolution. One of the critical tasks is to infer pseudo-time trajectory. However, the existence of transition cells in the intermediate state of complex biological processes poses a challenge for the trajectory inference. Here, we propose a new single-cell trajectory inference method based on transition entropy, named scTite, to identify transitional states and reconstruct cell trajectory from scRNA-seq data. Taking into account the continuity of cellular processes, we introduce a new metric called transition entropy to measure the uncertainty of a cell belonging to different cell clusters, and then identify cell states and transition cells. Specifically, we adopt different strategies to infer the trajectory for the identified cell states and transition cells, and combine them to obtain a detailed cell trajectory. For the identified cell clusters, we utilize the Wasserstein distance based on the probability distribution to calculate distance between clusters, and construct the minimum spanning tree. Meanwhile, we adopt the signaling entropy and partial correlation coefficient to determine transition paths, which contain a group of transition cells with the largest similarity. Then the transitional paths and the MST are combined to infer a refined cell trajectory. We apply scTite to four real scRNA-seq datasets and an integrated dataset, and conduct extensive performance comparison with nine existing trajectory inference methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct the cell trajectory more accurately than the compared algorithms. The scTite software package is available at https://github.com/dblab2022/scTite.},

	abstract = {A key challenge in systems biology is the elucidation of the underlying principles, or fundamental laws, which determine the cellular phenotype. Understanding how these fundamental principles are altered in diseases like cancer is important for translating basic scientific knowledge into clinical advances. While significant progress is being made, with the identification of novel drug targets and treatments by means of systems biological methods, our fundamental systems level understanding of why certain treatments succeed and others fail is still lacking. We here advocate a novel methodological framework for systems analysis and interpretation of molecular omic data, which is based on statistical mechanical principles. Specifically, we propose the notion of cellular signalling entropy (or uncertainty), as a novel means of analysing and interpreting omic data, and more fundamentally, as a means of elucidating systems-level principles underlying basic biology and disease. We describe the power of signalling entropy to discriminate cells according to differentiation potential and cancer status. We further argue the case for an empirical cellular entropy-robustness correlation theorem and demonstrate its existence in cancer cell line drug sensitivity data. Specifically, we find that high signalling entropy correlates with drug resistance and further describe how entropy could be used to identify the achilles heels of cancer cells. In summary, signalling entropy is a deep and powerful concept, based on rigorous statistical mechanical principles, which, with improved data quality and coverage, will allow a much deeper understanding of the systems biological principles underlying normal and disease physiology.},

Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signalling, so we assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. Using combined molecular-morphological analysis we demonstrate variable expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental signalling disruption, and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is represented by position shift along this axis, and is influenced by cell-intrinsic, extrinsic and therapeutic selective pressures.},

	abstract = {Single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to study dynamical biological processes, such as cell type differentiation, by inferring cell trajectories. To study the mechanisms underlying a biological process, genes whose expression patterns change smoothly along cell trajectories are identified. However, when a mixture of biological processes coexist in the system, they often cannot be effectively de-mixed using cell trajectory inference approaches. This poses a major challenge to identifying genes that mediate each process and delineating their temporal order. Here, instead of inferring trajectories of cells, we present a new approach, GeneTrajectory, to unravel trajectories of genes that can better resolve distinct biological processes. In our approach, we first compute a cell-cell graph that preserves the manifold structure of cells. Then, we construct a gene-gene graph where the affinities between genes are based on the Wasserstein distances between their distributions on the cell graph. Notably, this method does not require any knowledge of the cell trajectories. We use simulated and two real-world scRNA-seq datasets to demonstrate that GeneTrajectory reveals the gene dynamics underlying complex biological processes that cannot be resolved by commonly-used cell trajectory inference approaches.},

We found that expression of the RNA-binding protein Mex3a labels a slowly cycling subpopulation of Lgr5+ ISCs that contribute to all intestinal lineages with distinct kinetics. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that Lgr5+ cells adopt two discrete states, one of which is defined by a Mex3a expression program and relatively low levels of proliferation genes. During homeostasis, Mex3a+ cells continually shift into the rapidly dividing, self-renewing ISC pool. Chemotherapy and radiation preferentially target rapidly dividing Lgr5+ cells but spare the Mex3a-high/Lgr5+ population, helping to promote regeneration of the intestinal epithelium following toxic insults.

Quantitative mass spectrometry on the same cell populations identified 278 proteins enriched in intestinal stem cells. The mRNA and protein data sets showed a high level of correlation and a combined signature of 510 stem cell-enriched genes was defined. Spatial expression patterns were further characterized by mRNA in-situ hybridization, revealing that approximately half of the genes were expressed in a gradient with highest levels at the crypt bottom, while the other half was expressed uniquely in Lgr5+stem cells. Lineage tracing using a newly established knock-in mouse for one of the signature genes, Smoc2, confirmed its stem cell specificity.

We have previously shown that the Notch1 receptor is expressed in Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs); given the critical role played by Notch signalling in promoting intestinal tumourigenesis, we explored Notch1 expression in tumours. Combining lineage tracing in two tumour models with transcriptomic analyses, we found that Notch1+ tumour cells are undifferentiated, proliferative and capable of indefinite self-renewal and of generating a heterogeneous clonal progeny. Molecularly, the transcriptional signature of Notch1+ tumour cells highly correlates with ISCs, suggestive of their origin from normal crypt cells. Surprisingly, Notch1+ expression labels a subset of CSCs that shows reduced levels of Lgr5, a reported CSCs marker. The existence of distinct stem cell populations within intestinal tumours highlights the necessity of better understanding their hierarchy and behaviour, to identify the correct cellular targets for therapy.},

	abstract = {A frequent complication in colorectal cancer (CRC) is regeneration of the tumor after therapy. Here, we report that a gene signature specific for adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) predicts disease relapse in CRC patients. ISCs are marked by high expression of the EphB2 receptor, which becomes gradually silenced as cells differentiate. Using EphB2 and the ISC marker Lgr5, we have FACS-purified and profiled mouse ISCs, crypt proliferative progenitors, and late transient amplifying cells to define a gene program specific for normal ISCs. Furthermore, we discovered that ISC-specific genes identify a stem-like cell population positioned at the bottom of tumor structures reminiscent of crypts. EphB2 sorted ISC-like tumor cells display robust tumor-initiating capacity in immunodeficient mice as well as long-term self-renewal potential. Taken together, our data suggest that the ISC program defines a cancer stem cell niche within colorectal tumors and plays a central role in CRC relapse.},

We performed scRNA-seq analyses on immune and stromal populations from colorectal cancer patients, identifying specific macrophage and conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets as key mediators of cellular cross-talk in the tumor microenvironment. Defining comparable myeloid populations in mouse tumors enabled characterization of their response to myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-CSF1R preferentially depleted macrophages with an inflammatory signature but spared macrophage populations that in mouse and human expresses pro-angiogenic/tumorigenic genes. Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40+ Th1-like cells and CD8+ memory T cells. Our comprehensive analysis of key myeloid subsets in human and mouse identifies critical cellular interactions regulating tumor immunity and defines mechanisms underlying myeloid-targeted immunotherapies currently undergoing clinical testing.},

	abstract = {Renewal of the intestinal epithelium occurs approximately every week and requires a careful balance between cell proliferation and differentiation to maintain proper lineage ratios and support absorptive, secretory, and barrier functions. We review models used to study the mechanisms by which intestinal stem cells (ISCs) fuel the rapid turnover of the epithelium during homeostasis and might support epithelial regeneration after injury. In anatomically defined zones of the crypt stem cell niche, phenotypically distinct active and reserve ISC populations are believed to support homeostatic epithelial renewal and injury-induced regeneration, respectively. However, other cell types previously thought to be committed to differentiated states might also have ISC activity and participate in regeneration. Efforts are underway to reconcile the proposed relatively strict hierarchical relationships between reserve and active ISC pools and their differentiated progeny; findings from models provide evidence for phenotypic plasticity that is common among many if not all crypt-resident intestinal epithelial cells. We discuss the challenges to consensus on ISC nomenclature, technical considerations, and limitations inherent to methodologies used to define reserve ISCs, and the need for standardized metrics to quantify and compare the relative contributions of different epithelial cell types to homeostatic turnover and post-injury regeneration. Increasing our understanding of the high-resolution genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate reserve ISC function and cell plasticity will help refine these models and could affect approaches to promote tissue regeneration after intestinal injury.},

In the case of breast, the existence of a bipotent stem-like state is also controversial. Here we apply a marker-free algorithm to scRNA-Seq data from the human mammary epithelium, revealing a high-potency cell-state enriched for an independent mammary stem-cell expression module. We validate this stem-like state in independent scRNA-Seq data. Our algorithm further predicts that the stem-like state is bipotent, a prediction we are able to validate using FACS sorted bulk expression data. The bipotent stem-like state correlates with clinical outcome in basal breast cancer and is characterized by overexpression of YBX1 and ENO1, two modulators of basal breast cancer risk. This study illustrates the power of a marker-free computational framework to identify a novel bipotent stem-like state in the mammary epithelium.},

	abstract = {Trajectory inference is a common application of scRNA-seq data. However, it is often necessary to previously determine the origin of the trajectories, the stem or progenitor cells. In this work, we propose a computational tool to quantify pluripotency from single cell transcriptomics data. This approach uses the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with the differentiation process as a scaffold and the gene expression matrix to calculate a score that we call differentiation activity. This score reflects how active the differentiation network is for each cell. We benchmark the performance of our algorithm with two previously published tools, LandSCENT [1] and CytoTRACE [2], for four data sets: breast, colon, hematopoietic and lung. We show that our algorithm is more efficient than LandSCENT and requires less RAM memory than the other programs. We also illustrate a complete workflow from the count matrix to trajectory inference using the breast data set.

We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is, on average, 57\% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative algorithms in ground truth comparisons.},

We performed extensive bench-marks across both simulated and experimental datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry data, where distinct shows favourable performance, identifies more differential patterns than competitors, and displays good control of false positive and false discovery rates. distinct is available as a Bioconductor R package.},

	abstract = {Cell-cell interactions (CCIs) are essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate biological processes and functions. Many molecules and signaling processes can mediate CCIs. One classical type of CCI mediator is the interaction between secreted ligands and cell surface receptors, i.e., ligand-receptor (LR) interaction. With the recent development of single-cell technologies, a large amount of single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data has become widely available. This data availability motivated the single-cell-resolution study of CCIs, particularly LR-based CCIs. Dozens of computational methods and tools have been developed to predict CCIs by identifying LR-based CCIs. Many of these tools have been theoretically reviewed. However, there is little study on current LR-based CCI prediction tools regarding their performance and running results on public scRNA-Seq datasets. In this work, to fill this gap, we tested and compared nine of the most recent computational tools for LR-based CCI prediction. We used fifteen mouse scRNA-Seq samples that correspond to nearly 100K single cells under different experimental conditions for testing and comparison. Besides briefing the methodology used in these nine tools, we summarized the similarities and differences of these tools in terms of both LR prediction and CCI inference between cell types. We provided insight into using these tools to make meaningful discoveries in understanding cell communications.},

Characterization of the interactions between these cell types is necessary for revealing the complex nature of tumors. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to compare the tumor microenvironments between a mouse model of sporadic colorectal adenoma (Lrig1CreERT2/+;Apc2lox14/+) and a mouse model of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer induced by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS). While both models develop tumors in the distal colon, we found that the two tumor types have distinct microenvironments. AOM/DSS tumors have an increased abundance of two populations of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compared with APC tumors, and we revealed their divergent spatial association with tumor cells using multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging. We also identified a unique squamous cell population in AOM/DSS tumors, whose origins were distinct from anal squamous epithelial cells. These cells were in higher proportions upon administration of a chemotherapy regimen of 5-Fluorouracil/Irinotecan. We used computational inference algorithms to predict cell-cell communication mediated by ligand-receptor interactions and downstream pathway activation, and identified potential mechanistic connections between CAFs and tumor cells, as well as CAFs and squamous epithelial cells. This study provides important preclinical insight into the microenvironment of two distinct models of colorectal tumors and reveals unique roles for CAFs and squamous epithelial cells in the AOM/DSS model of inflammation-driven cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective Wnt signalling is critical for normal intestinal development and homeostasis. Wnt dysregulation occurs in almost all human and murine intestinal tumours and an optimal but not excessive level of Wnt activation is considered favourable for tumourigenesis. The authors assessed effects of pan-intestinal Wnt activation on tissue homeostasis, taking into account underlying physiological Wnt activity and stem-cell number in each region of the bowel.
Design The authors generated mice that expressed temporally controlled, stabilised β-catenin along the crypt–villus axis throughout the intestines. Physiological Wnt target gene activity was assessed in different regions of normal mouse and human tissue. Human intestinal tumour mutation spectra were analysed.
Results In the mouse, β-catenin stabilisation resulted in a graduated neoplastic response, ranging from dysplastic transformation of the entire epithelium in the proximal small bowel to slightly enlarged crypts of non-dysplastic morphology in the colorectum. In contrast, stem and proliferating cell numbers were increased in all intestinal regions. In the normal mouse and human intestines, stem-cell and Wnt gradients were non-identical, but higher in the small bowel than large bowel in both species. There was also variation in the expression of some Wnt modulators. Human tumour analysis confirmed that different APC mutation spectra are selected in different regions of the bowel.
Conclusions There are variable gradients in stem-cell number, physiological Wnt activity and response to pathologically increased Wnt signalling along the crypt-villus axis and throughout the length of the intestinal tract. The authors propose that this variation influences regional mutation spectra, tumour susceptibility and lesion distribution in mice and humans.},

Although the mesenchyme and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play critical roles in tissue homeostasis and regeneration2–5, their role in repurposing developmental programs in epithelium is unknown. To model epithelial regeneration, we culture intestinal epithelium on decellularized small intestinal scaffold (iECM), and identify Asporin (Aspn), an ECM bound proteoglycan, as a critical mediator of cellular reprogramming. Aspn is produced by the mesenchyme, and we show that its effect on epithelial Tgfβ-signalling via CD44 is critical for fetal-like conversion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Aspn is transiently increased upon chemotherapy-induced damage and pivotal for a timely induction of the fetal-like state and tissue regeneration. In summary, we establish a platform for modelling epithelial injury responses ex vivo, and show that the mesenchymal Aspn-producing niche controls tissue repair by regulating epithelial fetal-like reprogramming.},

	abstract = {The WNT pathway is a fundamental regulator of intestinal homeostasis, and hyperactivation of WNT signaling is the major oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer. To date, there are no described mechanisms that bypass WNT dependence in intestinal tumors. Here, we show that although WNT suppression blocks tumor growth in most organoid and in vivo colorectal cancer models, the accumulation of colorectal cancer–associated genetic alterations enables drug resistance and WNT-independent growth. In intestinal epithelial cells harboring mutations in KRAS or BRAF, together with disruption of TP53 and SMAD4, transient TGFβ exposure drives YAP/TAZ-dependent transcriptional reprogramming and lineage reversion. Acquisition of embryonic intestinal identity is accompanied by a permanent loss of adult intestinal lineages, and long-term WNT-independent growth. This work identifies genetic and microenvironmental factors that drive WNT inhibitor resistance, defines a new mechanism for WNT-independent colorectal cancer growth, and reveals how integration of associated genetic alterations and extracellular signals can overcome lineage-dependent oncogenic programs.Colorectal and intestinal cancers are driven by mutations in the WNT pathway, and drugs aimed at suppressing WNT signaling are in active clinical development. Our study identifies a mechanism of acquired resistance to WNT inhibition and highlights a potential strategy to target those drug-resistant cells.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1426},

This renders them inefficient and costly when processing small, individual tissue samples, a problem that tends to be resolved by loading bulk samples, yielding confounded mosaic cell population read-outs. Here, we developed a deterministic, mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation dropleting system, DisCo, aimed at processing low-input samples ({\textless}500 cells). We demonstrate that DisCo enables precise particle and cell positioning and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics, enabling continuous processing of low-input single-cell suspensions at high capture efficiency ({\textgreater}70\%) and at speeds up to 350 cells per hour. To underscore DisCo’s unique capabilities, we analyzed 31 individual intestinal organoids at varying developmental stages. This revealed extensive organoid heterogeneity, identifying distinct subtypes including a regenerative fetal-like Ly6a+ stem cell population that persists as symmetrical cysts, or spheroids, even under differentiation conditions, and an uncharacterized ‘gobloid’ subtype consisting predominantly of precursor and mature (Muc2+) goblet cells. To complement this dataset and to demonstrate DisCo’s capacity to process low-input, in vivo-derived tissues, we also analyzed individual mouse intestinal crypts. This revealed the existence of crypts with a compositional similarity to spheroids, which consisted predominantly of regenerative stem cells, suggesting the existence of regenerating crypts in the homeostatic intestine. These findings demonstrate the unique power of DisCo in providing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity in small, individual tissues.},

This is characterized by de novo expression of fetal markers as well as suppression of markers for adult stem and differentiated cells. The fate change is orchestrated by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), increased FAK/Src signaling, and ultimately YAP/TAZ activation. In a defined cell culture system recapitulating the extracellular matrix remodeling observed in vivo, we show that a collagen 3D matrix supplemented with Wnt ligands is sufficient to sustain endogenous YAP/TAZ and induce conversion of cell fate.

Here we describe different 3D culture systems to culture gastrointestinal epithelium that should enable us to study the stem cell niche in vitro in the future: organoid culture and multilayered systems such as organotypic cell culture and culture of intestinal tissue fragments ex vivo. These methods mimic the in vivo situation in vitro by creating 3D culture conditions that reflect the physiological situation of intestinal crypts. Modifications of the composition of the culture media as well as coculturing epithelial organoids with previously described cellular components such as myofibroblasts, collagen, and neurons show the impact of the methods applied to investigate niche interactions in vitro.

We show that disruption of β-catenin/TCF-4 activity in CRC cells induces a rapid G1 arrest and blocks a genetic program that is physiologically active in the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21CIP1/WAF1 promoter. Following disruption of β-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21CIP1/WAF1 transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation. Thus, the β-catenin/TCF-4 complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells.},

Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.},

The biomedical community is producing increasingly high dimensional datasets, integrated from hundreds of patient samples, which current computational techniques struggle to explore. To uncover biological meaning from these complex datasets, we present an approach called Multiscale PHATE, which learns abstracted biological features from data that can be directly predictive of disease. Built on a continuous coarse graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE creates a tree of data granularities that can be cut at coarse levels for high level summarizations of data, as well as at fine levels for detailed representations on subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to study the immune response to COVID-19 in 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients. Through our analysis of patient samples, we identify CD16hi CD66blo neutrophil and IFNγ+GranzymeB+ Th17 cell responses enriched in patients who die. Further, we show that population groupings Multiscale PHATE discovers can be directly fed into a classifier to predict disease outcome. We also use Multiscale PHATE-derived features to construct two different manifolds of patients, one from abstracted flow cytometry features and another directly on patient clinical features, both associating immune subsets and clinical markers with outcome.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances have led to an increase in the production and availability of single-cell data. The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed.We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an autoencoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 90\% and 78\% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples, respectively.https://github.com/ratschlab/scim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we study the differentiation state and cellular origin of 1300 childhood and adult kidney tumors. Using single cell mRNA reference maps of normal tissues, we quantify reference “cellular signals” in each tumor. Quantifying global differentiation, we find that childhood tumors exhibit fetal cellular signals, replacing the presumption of “fetalness” with a quantitative measure of immaturity. By contrast, in adult cancers our assessment refutes the suggestion of dedifferentiation towards a fetal state in most cases. We find an intimate connection between developmental mesenchymal populations and childhood renal tumors. We demonstrate the diagnostic potential of our approach with a case study of a cryptic renal tumor. Our findings provide a cellular definition of human renal tumors through an approach that is broadly applicable to human cancer.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death. Significant improvements in CRC treatment have been made for the last 20 years, on one hand thanks to a better detection, allowing surgical resection of the incriminated area, and on the other hand, thanks to a better knowledge of CRC’s development allowing the improvement of drug strategies. Despite this crucial progress, CRC remains a public health issue. The current model for CRC initiation and progression is based on accumulation of sequential known genetic mutations in the colon epithelial cells’ genome leading to a loss of control over proliferation and survival. However, increasing evidence reveals that CRC initiation is more complex. Indeed, chronic inflammatory contexts, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, have been shown to increase the risk for CRC development in mice and humans. In this manuscript, we review whether colon fibroblasts can go from the main regulators of the ISC homeostasis, regulating not only the renewal process but also the epithelial cells’ differentiation occurring along the colon crypt, to the main player in the initiation of the colorectal cancer process due to chronic inflammation.},

	abstract = {Claudin proteins comprise a recently described family of tight junction proteins that differentially regulate paracellular permeability. Since other tight junction proteins show alterations in distribution or expression in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) we assessed expression of claudins (CL) 2, 3 and 4 in IBD. CL 2 was strongly expressed along the inflamed crypt epithelium, whilst absent or barely detectable in normal colon. In contrast, CL 3 and 4 were present throughout normal colonic epithelium and were reduced or redistributed in the diseased surface epithelium. In a T84-cell culture model of the gut barrier, paracellular permeability decreased with time after plating and correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of CL 2. Addition of IFNγ/TNFα led to further decreases in CL 2 and 3, the redistrbution of CL 4 and a marked increase in paracellular permeability. Conversely, IL-13 dramatically increased CL 2, with little effect on CL 3 or 4, but also resulted in increased paracellular permeability. Expression of CL 2 did not correlate with proliferation or junctional reorganisation after calcium ion depletion. Re-expression of CL 2 in response to IL-13 was inhibited by phophatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, which also restored the ion permeability to previous levels. CL 2 expression could be stimulated in the absence of IL-13 by activation of phospho-Akt in the phophatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway. These results suggest that INFγ/TNFα and IL-13 have differential effects on CL 2, 3 and 4 in tight junctions, which may lead to increased permeability via different mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium forms a highly dynamic and selective barrier that controls absorption of fluid and solutes while restricting pathogen access to underlying tissues. Barrier properties are achieved by intercellular junctions that include an apical tight junction (TJ) and subjacent adherens junctions and desmosomes. The TJ tetraspan claudin proteins form pores between epithelial cells to control paracellular fluid and ion movement. In addition to regulation of barrier function, claudin family members control epithelial homeostasis and are expressed in a spatiotemporal manner in the intestinal crypt–luminal axis. This delicate balance of physiologic differential claudin protein expression is altered during mucosal inflammation. Inflammatory mediators influence transcriptional regulation, as well as endocytic trafficking, targeting, and retention of claudins in the TJ. Increased expression of intestinal epithelial claudin-1, -2, and -18 with downregulation of claudin-3, -4, -5, -7, -8, and -12 has been observed in intestinal inflammatory disorders. Such changes in claudin proteins modify the epithelial barrier function in addition to influencing epithelial and mucosal homeostasis. An improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control epithelial claudin proteins will provide strategies to strengthen the epithelial barrier function and restore mucosal homeostasis in inflammatory disorders.},

	abstract = {Intestinal epithelial stem cells are highly sensitive to differentiation induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Colorectal cancer develops from mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells. The most frequent initiating mutation occurs in Apc, which results in hyperactivated Wnt signalling. This causes hyperproliferation and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy, but whether these mutated stem cells are sensitive to ER stress induced differentiation remains unknown. Here we examined this by generating mice in which both Apc and ER stress repressor chaperone Grp78 can be conditionally deleted from the intestinal epithelium. For molecular studies, we used intestinal organoids derived from these mice. Homozygous loss of Apc alone resulted in crypt elongation, activation of the Wnt signature and accumulation of intestinal epithelial stem cells, as expected. This phenotype was however completely rescued on activation of ER stress by additional deletion of Grp78. In these Apc-Grp78 double mutant animals, stem cells were rapidly lost and repopulation occurred by non-mutant cells that had escaped recombination, suggesting that Apc-Grp78 double mutant stem cells had lost self-renewal capacity. Although in Apc-Grp78 double mutant mice the Wnt signature was lost, these intestines exhibited ubiquitous epithelial presence of nuclear β-catenin. This suggests that ER stress interferes with Wnt signalling downstream of nuclear β-catenin. In conclusion, our findings indicate that ER stress signalling results in loss of Apc mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells by interference with the Wnt signature. In contrast to many known inhibitors of Wnt signalling, ER stress acts downstream of β-catenin. Therefore, ER stress poses a promising target in colorectal cancers, which develop as a result of Wnt activating mutations.},

We show that in normal intestinal epithelium, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activity of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are induced at the transition from stem cell to transit-amplifying cell. Induction of ER stress causes loss of stemness in a Perk-eIF2α-dependent manner.

Serial analyses of gene expression levels revealed high levels of expression in early and late intestinal neoplasm in both mice and humans. Using a conditional mouse model of Apc inactivation and a human colon carcinoma cell line, we showed that IFITM gene expression is rapidly induced after activation of the beta-catenin signaling.

There was no significant difference in gene expression between the primary tumors and the liver metastases. The most highly overexpressed gene in both the primary tumors and the liver metastases was the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C gene (UBE2C), located at 20q13.1. Additionally, two-color FISH analysis using probes for the region 20q13.1 and the chromosome 20 centromere revealed that amplification at 20q13.1 had occurred in 5 of 10 (50\%) colon cancers. Comparison between the levels of gene expression and FISH results revealed that UBE2C expression is significantly changed by amplification at 20q13.1, suggesting genomic amplification as one mechanism of increased UBE2C expression.

However, even though it is increasingly implicated in mammalian development, H1.5 has not received as much research attention as its relatives. Recent studies have focused on its prognostic value in cancer patients and its contribution to tumorigenesis through specific molecular mechanisms. However, many functions of H1.5 are still poorly understood. In this review, we will summarize what is currently known about H1.5 and its function in cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. We will suggest key experiments that are required to understand the molecular network, in which H1.5 is embedded.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the third most common cancer in men and women. Around 20\% colon cancer cases are closely linked with colitis. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to colon inflammation and tumor development. However, the genetic factors regulating colitis and colon tumorigenesis remain elusive. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vitally involved in tissue inflammation and tumorigenesis, here we employed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to systemically identify the genetic factors involved in the regulation of oxidative stress. Next generation sequencing (NGS) showed that over 600 gRNAs including the ones targeting LGALS2 were highly enriched in cells survived after sublethal H2O2 challenge. LGALS2 encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin 2 (Gal2), which is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and downregulated in human colon tumors. To examine the role of Gal2 in colitis, we employed the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis model in mice with (WT) or without Lgals2 (Gal2-KO) and showed that Gal2 deficiency ameliorated DSS-induced colitis. We further demonstrated that Gal2-KO mice developed significantly larger tumors than WT mice using Azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal cancer model. We found that STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly increased in Gal2-deficient tumors as compared to those in WT mice. Gal2 overexpression decreased the proliferation of human colon tumor epithelial cells and blunted H2O2-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Overall, our results demonstrate that Gal2 plays a suppressive role in colon tumor growth and highlights the therapeutic potential of Gal2 in colon cancer.},

These perturbations can manifest as a shift in the abundance of cells associated with a biological condition. Current computational workflows for comparative analyses typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance between experimental conditions. However, clusters are not always an optimal representation of the biological manifold on which cells lie, especially in the context of continuous differentiation trajectories. To overcome these barriers to discovery, we present \textit{Milo}, a flexible and scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighbourhoods on a k-nearest neighbour graph. Our method samples and refines neighbourhoods across the graph and leverages the flexibility of generalized linear models, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental settings. Using simulations, we show that \textit{Milo} is both robust and sensitive, and can reveal subtle but important cell state perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters. We illustrate the power of \textit{Milo} by identifying the perturbed differentiation during ageing of a lineage-biased thymic epithelial precursor state and by uncovering extensive perturbation to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. \textit{Milo} is provided as an open-source R software package with documentation and tutorials at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

To describe the relevant cell populations in an unbiased manner, we carried out a single-cell transcriptome analysis of the adult murine colon, producing a high-quality atlas of matched colonic epithelium and mesenchyme. We identify two crypt-associated colonic fibroblast populations that are demarcated by different strengths of platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (Pdgfra) expression. Crypt-bottom fibroblasts (CBFs), close to the intestinal stem cells, express low levels of Pdgfra and secrete canonical Wnt ligands, Wnt potentiators, and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) inhibitors. Crypt-top fibroblasts (CTFs) exhibit high Pdgfra levels and secrete noncanonical Wnts and Bmp ligands. While the Pdgfralow cells maintain intestinal stem cell proliferation, the Pdgfrahigh cells induce differentiation of the epithelial cells. Our findings enhance our understanding of the crosstalk between various colonic epithelial cells and their associated mesenchymal signaling hubs along the crypt axis—placing differential Pdgfra expression levels in the spotlight of intestinal fibroblast identity.},

But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity \textit{in vivo}. Our work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier dysfunction in IBD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent studies have described fibroblast heterogeneity within individual tissues. However, the field lacks a definition of fibroblasts at single-cell resolution across tissues in healthy and diseased organs. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA transcriptomic data from {\textasciitilde}150,000 fibroblast cells derived from 16 steady- and 11 perturbed-state mouse organs into fibroblast atlases. These data revealed two universal fibroblast cell subtypes, marked by expression of Pi16 or Col15a1, in all tissues; it also revealed discrete subsets of five specialized fibroblast subtypes in steady-state tissues and three activated fibroblast subtypes in perturbed or diseased tissues. These subsets were transcriptionally shaped by microenvironmental context rather than tissue-type alone. Inference of fibroblast lineage structure from the murine steady-state and perturbed-state fibroblast atlases suggested that specialized and activated subtypes are developmentally related to universal tissue-resident fibroblasts. Analysis of human samples revealed that fibroblast subtypes found in mice are conserved between species, including universal fibroblasts and activated phenotypes associated with pathogenicity in human cancer, fibrosis, arthritis and inflammation. In sum, a cross-species and pan-tissue approach to transcriptomics at single-cell resolution enabled us to define the organizing principles of the fibroblast lineage in health and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

New approaches such as single-cell transcriptomics and the use of organoid models have led to the identification of the signals that guide fate specification of stem cell progeny into the six intestinal cell lineages. These cell types display context-dependent functionality and can adapt to different requirements over their lifetime, as dictated by their microenvironment.

Stem cells have the ability to self-renew and differentiate along multiple lineages, driving tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Paradigms of unidirectional, hierarchical differentiation trajectories observed in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells have traditionally been applied to tissue-resident stem cells. However, accumulating evidence implicates stemness as a bidirectional, dynamic state that is largely governed by the niche, which facilitates plasticity and adaptability to changing conditions. In this Review, we discuss mechanisms of cell fate regulation through niche-derived cues, with a particular focus on epithelial stem cells of the mammalian skin, intestine and lung. We discuss a spectrum of niche-derived biochemical, mechanical and architectural inputs that define stem cell states during morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, and highlight how these diverse inputs influence stem cell plasticity.},

	abstract = {Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell RNA-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce tradeSeq, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

However, the sensitivity of wild-type GFP has been below that of standard reporter proteins, such as β-galactosidase, which utilize enzymatic amplification. To improve the detection of GFP in transfected mammalian cells, we have constructed a unique GFP variant which contains chromophore mutations that make the protein 35 times brighter than wild-type GFP, and is codon-optimized for higher expression in mammalian cells. These changes in the GFP coding sequence provide an enhanced GFP (EGFP) that greatly increases the sensitivity of the reporter protein. We show that the EGFP expression vector delivered into mammalian cells gives rise to bright fluorescence that is readily detectable following a 16-24 hr transfection interval. Visual detection of transfected cells with EGFP appears to be more sensitive than equivalent measurements with β-galactosidase catalyzed conversion of the X-gal substrate. We conclude that EGFP allows sensitive and convenient detection of gene transfer in mammalian cells.},

Unfortunately, all wild-type yellow-to-red fluorescent proteins reported so far are obligately tetrameric and often toxic or disruptive4,5. The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent protein “DsRed” by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation6, then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which cumulatively required 33 substitutions7. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1. Three monomers with distinguishable hues from yellow-orange to red-orange have higher quantum efficiencies.},

With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.

We report here on the next generation Flow Cytometry Standard data file format. FCS 3.1 is a minor revision based on suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the Standard is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type., The FCS 3.1 standard retains the basic FCS file structure and most features of previous versions of the standard. Changes included in FCS 3.1 address potential ambiguities in the previous versions and provide a more robust standard. The major changes include simplified support for international characters and improved support for storing compensation. The major additions are support for preferred display scale, a standardized way of capturing the sample volume, information about originality of the data file, and support for plate and well identification in high throughput, plate based experiments.

	abstract = {We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

Initial genetic changes start in an early adenoma and accumulate as it transforms to carcinoma. Chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways are responsible for genetic instability in colorectal cancer. Chromosomal instability pathway consist of activation of proto-oncogenes (KRAS) and inactivation of at least three tumor suppression genes, namely loss of APC, p53 and loss of heterozogosity (LOH) of long arm of chromosome 18. Mutations of TGFBR and PIK3CA genes have also been recently described. Herein we briefly discuss the basic concepts of genetic integrity and the consequences of defects in the DNA repair relevant to CRC. Epigenetic alterations, essential in CRC tumorigenesis, are also reviewed alongside clinical information relevant to CRC.},

Organoid culturing has also been applied to study gastrointestinal diseases, intestinal-microbe interactions, and colorectal cancer. These models are amenable to CRISPR gene editing and drug treatments, including high-throughput small-molecule testing. Three-dimensional intestinal cultures have been transplanted into mice to develop versatile in vivo models of intestinal disease, particularly cancer. Limitations of currently available organoid models include cost and challenges in modeling nonepithelial intestinal cells, such as immune cells and the microbiota.

	abstract = {Blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints (ICs) is a promising therapeutic approach; however, it has shown limited success in some cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is largely responsible for response to therapy, and its constituents may provide robust biomarkers for successful immunotherapeutic approaches. In this study, we performed phenotypical characterization and critical analyses of key inhibitory ICs and T regulatory cell (Treg)-related markers on CD4+ T cell subsets in CRC patients, and compared with normal colon tissues and peripheral blood from the same patients. We also investigated correlations between the levels of different CD4+ T cell subsets and the clinicopathologic features including disease stage and tumor budding. We found a significant increase in the levels of CD4+FoxP3+Helios+ T cells, which represent potentially highly immunosuppressive Tregs, in the CRC TME. Additionally, tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells upregulated programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). We also characterized the expression of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 on different CD4+FoxP3−/+Helios−/+ T cell subsets. Interestingly, we found that CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 were mainly co-expressed on FoxP3+Helios+ Tregs in the TME. Additionally, FoxP3high Tregs expressed higher levels of Helios, CTLA-4 and TIM-3 than FoxP3low T cells. These results highlight the significance of Tregs in the CRC TME and suggest that Tregs may hamper response to IC blockade in CRC patients, but effects of different IC inhibition regimes on Treg levels or activity warrants further investigations. We also found that CD4+CTLA-4+ T cells in circulation are increased in patients with advanced disease stage. This study simultaneously provides important insights into the differential levels of CD4+ T cell subpopulations and IC expression in CRC TME, compared to periphery and associations with clinicopathologic features, which could be used as potential biomarkers for CRC progression and response to therapy.},

	abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Predictions of the future burden of the disease inform health planners and raise awareness of the need for cancer control action. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for 1989–2016 were used to project colon and rectal cancer mortality rates and number of deaths in 42 countries up to the year 2035, using age-period-cohort (APC) modelling. Mortality rates for colon cancer are predicted to continue decreasing in the majority of included countries from Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania, except Latin America and Caribbean countries. Mortality rates from rectal cancer in general followed those of colon cancer, however rates are predicted to increase substantially in Costa Rica (+73.6\%), Australia (+59.2\%), United States (+27.8\%), Ireland (+24.2\%) and Canada (+24.1\%). Despite heterogeneous trends in rates, the number of deaths is expected to rise in all countries for both colon and rectal cancer by 60.0\% and 71.5\% until 2035, respectively, due to population growth and ageing. Reductions in colon and rectal cancer mortality rates are probably due to better accessibility to early detection services and improved specialized care. The expected increase in rectal cancer mortality rates in some countries is worrisome and warrants further investigations.},

Fibroblasts are the principal stromal cells that exist in whole organs and play vital roles in many biological processes. Although the functional diversity of fibroblasts has been estimated, a comprehensive analysis of fibroblasts from the whole body has not been performed and their transcriptional diversity has not been sufficiently explored. The aim of this study was to elucidate the transcriptional diversity of human fibroblasts within the whole body.

Methods
Global gene expression analysis was performed on 63 human primary fibroblasts from 13 organs. Of these, 32 fibroblasts from gastrointestinal organs (gastrointestinal fibroblasts: GIFs) were obtained from a pair of 2 anatomical sites: the submucosal layer (submucosal fibroblasts: SMFs) and the subperitoneal layer (subperitoneal fibroblasts: SPFs). Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we elucidated identifiable subgroups of fibroblasts and analyzed the transcriptional character of each subgroup.

Results
In unsupervised clustering, 2 major clusters that separate GIFs and non-GIFs were observed. Organ- and anatomical site-dependent clusters within GIFs were also observed. The signature genes that discriminated GIFs from non-GIFs, SMFs from SPFs, and the fibroblasts of one organ from another organ consisted of genes associated with transcriptional regulation, signaling ligands, and extracellular matrix remodeling.

Conclusions
GIFs are characteristic fibroblasts with specific gene expressions from transcriptional regulation, signaling ligands, and extracellular matrix remodeling related genes. In addition, the anatomical site- and organ-dependent diversity of GIFs was also discovered. These features of GIFs contribute to their specific physiological function and homeostatic maintenance, and create a functional diversity of the gastrointestinal tract.},

	abstract = {Cellular circuits sense the environment, process signals, and compute decisions using networks of interacting proteins. To model such a system, the abundance of each activated protein species can be described as a stochastic function of the abundance of other proteins. High-dimensional single-cell technologies, like mass cytometry, offer an opportunity to characterize signaling circuit-wide. However, the challenge of developing and applying computational approaches to interpret such complex data remains. Here, we developed computational methods, based on established statistical concepts, to characterize signaling network relationships by quantifying the strengths of network edges and deriving signaling response functions. In comparing signaling between naïve and antigen-exposed CD4+ T-lymphocytes, we find that although these two cell subtypes had similarly-wired networks, naïve cells transmitted more information along a key signaling cascade than did antigen-exposed cells. We validated our characterization on mice lacking the extracellular-regulated MAP kinase (ERK2), which showed stronger influence of pERK on pS6 (phosphorylated-ribosomal protein S6), in naïve cells compared to antigen-exposed cells, as predicted. We demonstrate that by using cell-to-cell variation inherent in single cell data, we can algorithmically derive response functions underlying molecular circuits and drive the understanding of how cells process signals.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

These dimensions include a myriad of properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identification of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important features and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine. Finally, we discuss current challenges in biomedical integrative methods and our perspective on the future development of the field.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework for combining datasets via alignment of their intrinsic geometry. This alignment can be used to fuse data originating from disparate modalities, or to correct batch effects while preserving intrinsic data structure. Importantly, we do not assume any pointwise correspondence between datasets, but instead rely on correspondence between a (possibly unknown) subset of data features. We leverage this assumption to construct an isometric alignment between the data. This alignment is obtained by relating the expansion of data features in harmonics derived from diffusion operators defined over each dataset. These expansions encode each feature as a function of the data geometry. We use this to relate the diffusion coordinates of each dataset through our assumption of partial feature correspondence. Then, a unified diffusion geometry is constructed over the aligned data, which can also be used to correct the original data measurements. We demonstrate our method on several datasets, showing in particular its effectiveness in biological applications including fusion of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data measured on the same population of cells, and removal of batch effect between biological samples.},

In this review, we cover one of the most promising avenues of research into unlocking the potential of scRNA-seq data: the field of manifold learning, and the related manifold assumption in data analysis. Manifold learning provides a powerful structure for algorithmic approaches to process the data, extract its dynamics, and infer patterns in it.

To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the re-establishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability. Our study reveals that CRC cells can revert to functioning normal cells given appropriate signals, and provide compelling in vivo validation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target for treatment of CRC.,},

Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets. We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable timeframes. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST.

For proteins regulated at the transcript level, we observe a 7.7 hour delay between peak expression of transcript and protein on average.

Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs.
Science, this issue p. 189
To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.

Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method to use., 
Methods: Here we use one gold standard 10x Genomics dataset, generated from the mixture of three cell lines, as well as multiple silver standard 10x Genomics datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine not only the accuracy but also running time and robustness of a dozen methods., 
Results: We found that Seurat outperformed other methods, although performance seems to be dependent on many factors, including the complexity of the studied system. Furthermore, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other., 
Conclusions: In light of this we conclude that the choice of clustering tool crucially determines interpretation of scRNA-seq data generated by 10x Genomics. Hence practitioners and consumers should remain vigilant about the outcome of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq analysis.},

	abstract = {The transcriptome of single cells can reveal important information about cellular states and heterogeneity within populations of cells. Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Technologies to sequence the transcriptome, genome or epigenome from thousands of single cells in an experiment provide extraordinary resolution into the molecular states present within a complex biological system at any given moment. However, it is a major challenge to integrate single-cell sequencing data across experiments, conditions, batches, timepoints and other technical considerations. New computational methods are required that can simultaneously preserve biological signals, while also integrating samples. Here, we propose an unsupervised reference-free data representation, Cluster Similarity Spectrum (CSS), where each cell is represented by its similarities to clusters independently identified across samples. We show that CSS can be used to assess cell heterogeneity and enable differentiation trajectory reconstruction from cerebral organoid single-cell transcriptome data, and to integrate data across individuals and experimental conditions. We compare CSS to other integration algorithms and show that CSS performs comparably well. We also show that CSS allows projection of single-cell genomic data of different modalities to the CSS-represented reference atlas for visualization and cell type identity prediction. We think CSS provides a straightforward and powerful approach to understand and integrate challenging single-cell multi-omic data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It is increasingly common to encounter data from dynamic processes captured by static cross-sectional measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings. Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model continuous dynamics and non-linear paths that entities can take in these systems. To address this issue, we establish a link between continuous normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport, that allows us to model the expected paths of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution. We present TrajectoryNet, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of QFMatch by evaluating sample datasets from immunology studies. The algorithm is based on a novel multivariate extension of the quadratic form distance for the comparison of flow cytometry data sets.

We found that cell cycle dominates the variability within each population and that there is a lower frequency of cells in the G1 phase among old compared with young long-term HSCs, suggesting that they traverse through G1 faster. Moreover, transcriptional changes in HSCs during aging are inversely related to those upon HSC differentiation, such that old short-term (ST) HSCs resemble young long-term (LT-HSCs), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state. Our results indicate both compositional changes and intrinsic, population-wide changes with age and are consistent with a model where a relationship between cell cycle progression and self-renewal versus differentiation of HSCs is affected by aging and may contribute to the functional decline of old HSCs.},

To date, there are no described mechanisms that bypass WNT dependence in intestinal tumors. Here, we show that while WNT suppression blocks tumor growth in most organoid and in vivo CRC models, the accumulation of CRC-associated genetic alterations enables drug resistance and WNT-independent growth. In intestinal epithelial cells harboring mutations in KRAS or BRAF, together with disruption of p53 and SMAD4, transient TGFβ exposure drives YAP/TAZ-dependent transcriptional reprogramming and lineage reversion. Acquisition of embryonic intestinal identity is accompanied by a permanent loss of adult intestinal lineages, and long-term WNT-independent growth. This work delineates genetic and microenvironmental factors that drive WNT inhibitor resistance, identifies a new mechanism for WNT-independent CRC growth and reveals how integration of associated genetic alterations and extracellular signals can overcome lineage-dependent oncogenic programs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The rise of longitudinal single-cell sequencing experiments on patient-derived cell cultures, xenografts and organoids is opening new opportunities to track cancer evolution in single tumors and to investigate intra-tumor heterogeneity. This is particularly relevant when assessing the efficacy of therapies over time on the clonal composition of a tumor and in the identification of resistant subclones. We here introduce LACE (Longitudinal Analysis of Cancer Evolution), the first algorithmic framework that processes single-cell somatic mutation profiles from cancer samples collected at different time points and in distinct experimental settings, to produce longitudinal models of cancer evolution. Our approach solves a Boolean matrix factorization problem with phylogenetic constraints, by maximizing a weighted likelihood function computed on multiple time points, and we show with simulations that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both bulk and single-cell sequencing data. Remarkably, as the results are robust with respect to high levels of data-specific errors, LACE can be employed to process single-cell mutational profiles as generated by calling variants from the increasingly available scRNA-seq data, thus obviating the need of relying on rarer and more expensive genome sequencing experiments. This also allows to investigate the relation between genomic clonal evolution and phenotype at the single-cell level. To illustrate the capabilities of LACE, we show its application to a longitudinal scRNA-seq dataset of patient-derived xenografts of BRAF$^{\textrm{V600E/K}}$ mutant melanomas, in which we characterize the impact of concurrent BRAF/MEK-inhibition on clonal evolution, also by showing that distinct genetic clones reveal different sensitivity to the therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In colorectal cancer, oncogenic mutations transform a hierarchically organized and homeostatic epithelium into invasive cancer tissue. To define differences in cellular composition between the normal colon and colorectal cancer, and to map potential cellular interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment, we profiled transcriptomes of \&gt;50,000 single cells from tumors and matched normal tissues of eight colorectal cancer patients. We find that tumor formation is accompanied by changes in epithelial, immune and stromal cell compartments in all patients. In the epithelium, we identify a continuum of five tumor-specific stem cell and progenitor-like populations, and persistent multilineage differentiation. We find multiple stromal and immune cell types to be consistently expanded in tumor compared to the normal colon, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, pericytes, monocytes, macrophages and a subset of T cells. We identify epithelial tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts as relevant for assigning colorectal cancer consensus molecular subtypes. Our survey of growth factors in the tumor microenvironment identifies cell types responsible for increased paracrine EGFR, MET and TGF-β signaling in tumor tissue compared to the normal colon. We show that matched colorectal cancer organoids retain cell type heterogeneity, allowing to define a distinct differentiation trajectory encompassing stem and progenitor-like tumor cells. In summary, our single-cell analyses provide insights into cell types and signals shaping colorectal cancer cell plasticity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice.

This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cell atlas projects and single-cell CRISPR screens hit the limits of current technology, as they require cost-effective profiling for millions of individual cells. To satisfy these enormous throughput requirements, we developed "single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing" (scifi) and applied it to single-cell RNA sequencing. The resulting scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial pre-indexing of single-cell transcriptomes with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using widely available droplet microfluidics. Pre-indexing allows us to load multiple cells per droplet, which increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq up to 15-fold, and it provides a straightforward way of multiplexing hundreds of samples in a single scifi-RNA-seq experiment. Compared to multi-round combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easier, faster, and more efficient workflow, thereby enabling massive-scale scRNA-seq experiments for a broad range of applications ranging from population genomics to drug screens with scRNA-seq readout. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, and we demonstrated its feasibility for human primary material by profiling TCR activation in T cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this review, we revise and discuss the recent results describing actions of p120-catenin in different phases of this pathway. More specifically, we comment its involvement in four different steps: (i) the very early activation of CK1ɛ, essential for Dvl-2 binding to the Wnt receptor complex; (ii) the internalization of GSK3 and Axin into multivesicular bodies, necessary for a complete stabilization of β-catenin; (iii) the activation of Rac1 small GTPase, required for β-catenin translocation to the nucleus; and (iv) the release of the inhibitory action caused by Kaiso transcriptional repressor. We integrate these new results with the previously known action of other elements in this pathway, giving a particular relevance to the responses of the Wnt pathway not required for β-catenin stabilization but for β-catenin transcriptional activity. Moreover, we discuss the possible future implications, suggesting that the two cellular compartments where β-catenin is localized, thus, the adherens junction complex and the Wnt signalosome, are more physically connected that previously thought.},

NLBP is also known as a negative regulator of cell invasion, and its expression is reduced in several cancer cell lines that have little invasive activity. Although these phenomena suggest that NLBP may be a potential tumor suppressor, its role as a tumor suppressor in human lung cancer is not well established. In contrast to our expectation, NLBP was highly expressed in the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma tissues, and overexpression of NLBP promoted proliferation of H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found that p120 catenin (p120ctn) was a novel binding partner of NLBP, and that NLBP binds to the regulatory domain of p120ctn, and p120ctn associates with N-terminal region of NLBP, respectively. This binding leads to p120ctn stability to inhibit proteasomal degradation of p120ctn by inhibiting its ubiqutination. In addition, we also found that overexpression of NLBP and p120ctn in human lung cancer are closely related with adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma. Taken together, our findings reveal that NLBP is highly overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma, and that overexpression of NLBP promotes the cell proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma through interacting with p120ctn and suggest that NLBP may function as an oncogene in early stage carcinogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma.},

Our data revealed a global rewiring of the transcriptome and proteome between intestinal stem cells and enterocytes, with the majority of dynamic protein expression being transcription-driven. Integrating absolute mRNA and protein copy numbers revealed post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Probing the epigenetic landscape identified a large number of cell-type-specific regulatory elements, which revealed Hnf4g as a major driver of enterocyte differentiation.

	abstract = {Genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been proposed as a source for transplantation therapies and are rapidly becoming valuable tools for human disease modeling. However, many applications are limited due to the lack of robust differentiation paradigms that allow for the isolation of defined functional tissues. Here, using an endogenous LGR5-GFP reporter, we derived adult stem cells from hPSCs that gave rise to functional human intestinal tissue comprising all major cell types of the intestine. Histological and functional analyses revealed that such human organoid cultures could be derived with high purity and with a composition and morphology similar to those of cultures obtained from human biopsies. Importantly, hPSC-derived organoids responded to the canonical signaling pathways that control self-renewal and differentiation in the adult human intestinal stem cell compartment. This adult stem cell system provides a platform for studying human intestinal disease in vitro using genetically engineered hPSCs.,

Furthermore, the fact that these tissues can be derived from human progenitors allows for the study of uniquely human processes and disorders. This article and accompanying poster highlight the currently available methods, particularly those aimed at modelling human biology, and provide an overview of their capabilities and limitations.

In vitro three-dimensional (3D) cultures are emerging as novel systems with which to study tissue development, organogenesis and stem cell behavior ex vivo. When grown in a 3D environment, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-organize into organoids and acquire the right tissue patterning to develop into several endoderm- and ectoderm-derived tissues, mimicking their in vivo counterparts. Tissue-resident adult stem cells (AdSCs) also form organoids when grown in 3D and can be propagated in vitro for long periods of time. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the generation of pluripotent stem cell- and AdSC-derived organoids, highlighting their potential for enhancing our understanding of human development. We will also explore how this new culture system allows disease modeling and gene repair for a personalized regenerative medicine approach.},

Simultaneous measurement of 28 PTMs in \&gt;1 million single small intestinal organoid cells by mass cytometry reveals cell-type and cell-state specific signalling networks in stem, Paneth, enteroendocrine, tuft, goblet cells, and enterocytes. Integrating single-cell PTM analysis with Thiol-reactive Organoid Barcoding \textit{in situ} (TOB\textit{is}) enables high-throughput comparison of signalling networks between organoid cultures.

Cell surface expression of the cadherin-catenin complex is often directly correlated with the level of adhesion, however, examples exist where cadherin appears to be inactive and cells are completely non-adhesive. The state of p120-catenin phosphorylation has been implicated in regulating the adhesive activity of E-cadherin but the mechanism is currently unclear. We have found that destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, independent of microtubule plus-end dynamics, dephosphorylates p120-catenin and activates E-cadherin adhesion in Colo 205 cells. Through chemical screening, we have also identified several kinases as potential regulators of E-cadherin adhesive activity. Analysis of several p120-catenin phosphomutants suggests that gross dephosphorylation of p120-catenin rather than that of specific amino acids may trigger E-cadherin adhesion. Uncoupling p120-catenin binding to E-cadherin at the membrane causes constitutive adhesion in Colo 205 cells, further supporting an inhibitory role of phosphorylated p120-catenin on E-cadherin activity.},

Conventional bulk measurement by averaging the biological responses across a population often loses the information of cellular variations. Single-cell proteomic technologies are becoming increasingly important to understand and discern cellular heterogeneity. The well-established methods for single-cell protein analysis based on flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are limited by the low multiplexing ability owing to the spectra overlap of fluorophores for labeling antibodies. Recent advances in mass-spectrometry, microchip, and reiterative staining-based techniques for single-cell proteomics have enabled the evaluation of cellular heterogeneity with high throughput, increased multiplexity, and improved sensitivity. In this review, we describe the principles, developments, advantages and limitations of these advanced technologies in analysis of single-cell proteins, along with their biological applications to study cellular heterogeneity. At last, we discuss the remaining challenges, possible strategies, and future opportunities that will facilitate the improvement and broad applications of single-cell proteomic technologies in cell biology and medical research.

We show how different experimental conditions can be used to facilitate causal discovery, and apply two fundamental methods that produce context-specific causal predictions.

	abstract = {Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject., Recently, the cytometry field has experienced rapid advancement in the development of mass cytometry (CyTOF). CyTOF enables a significant increase in the ability to monitor 50 or more cellular markers for millions of cells at the single-cell level. Initial studies with CyTOF focused on few samples, in which expert manual discovery of cell types were acceptable. As the technology matures, it is now feasible to collect more samples, which enables systematic studies of cell types across multiple samples. However, the statistical and computational issues surrounding multi-sample analysis have not been previously examined in detail. Furthermore, it was not clear how the data analysis could be scaled for hundreds of samples, such as those in clinical studies. In this work, we present a scalable analysis pipeline that is grounded in strong statistical foundation. Partition-Assisted Clustering (PAC) offers fast and accurate clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (MAN) utilizes network structures learned from each homogeneous cluster to organize the data into data-set level clusters. PAC-MAN thus enables the analysis of a large CyTOF dataset that was previously too large to be analyzed systematically; this pipeline can be extended to the analysis of similarly large or larger datasets.},

Computational approaches can complement these datasets by additional predictions, but most available tools use prediction models pre-trained for single PTM type by the developers and it remains a difficult task to perform large-scale batch prediction for multiple PTMs with flexible user control, including the choice of training data. We developed an R package called PTMscape which predicts PTM sites across the proteome based on a unified and comprehensive set of descriptors of the physico-chemical microenvironment of modified sites, with additional downstream analysis modules to test enrichment of individual or pairs of PTMs in protein domains. PTMscape is flexible in the ability to process any major modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, while achieving the sensitivity and specificity comparable to single-PTM methods and outperforming other multi-PTM tools. Applying this framework, we expanded proteome-wide coverage of five major PTMs affecting different residues by prediction, especially for lysine and arginine modifications. Using a combination of experimentally acquired sites (PSP) and newly predicted sites, we discovered that the crosstalk among multiple PTMs occur more frequently than by random chance in key protein domains such as histone, protein kinase, and RNA recognition motifs, spanning various biological processes such as RNA processing, DNA damage response, signal transduction, and regulation of cell cycle. These results provide a proteome-scale analysis of crosstalk among major PTMs and can be easily extended to other types of PTM.},

We demonstrate quantitative, full periodic table coverage across a five-log dynamic range, imaging 36 labeled antibodies simultaneously with histochemical stains and endogenous elements. We image fields of view up to 800 μm × 800 μm at resolutions down to 260 nm with sensitivities approaching single-molecule detection. We leverage these properties to interrogate intrapatient heterogeneity in tumor organization in triple-negative breast cancer, revealing regional variability in tumor cell phenotypes in contrast to a structured immune response. Given its versatility and sample back-compatibility, MIBI-TOF is positioned to leverage existing annotated, archival tissue cohorts to explore emerging questions in cancer, immunology, and neurobiology.

Unlike single cell cultures, there are no reliable automated segmentation techniques that allow for the localization and quantification of organoids in their 3D culture environment. Here we describe OrgaQuant, a deep convolutional neural network implementation that can locate and quantify the size distribution of human intestinal organoids in brightfield images. OrgaQuant is an end-to-end trained neural network that requires no parameter tweaking; thus, it can be fully automated to analyze thousands of images with no user intervention. To develop OrgaQuant, we created a unique dataset of manually annotated human intestinal organoid images with bounding boxes and trained an object detection pipeline using TensorFlow.

However, these GANs are not explicitly designed for proper alignment of manifolds. We present a new GAN called the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together. In our demonstrated examples, cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that the MAGAN successfully aligns them such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other recently proposed models.},

	abstract = {Dishing out treatment recommendations
The number of treatment options for cancer patients keeps expanding, but it remains difficult to predict which tumors will be sensitive to which treatments. As a result, most patients receive treatment according to standardized protocols. With this approach, some patients respond to treatment, but others only experience side effects. To help address this situation, Ooft et al. developed a method of testing drugs in patient-derived organoids, biopsy-derived cells from individual patients grown in a dish. In a clinical study, the responses of organoids to irinotecan correlated with patients’ responses to the drug, suggesting that organoids could help avoid giving irinotecan to patients who would not benefit.
There is a clear and unmet clinical need for biomarkers to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy for cancer. We developed an in vitro test based on patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from metastatic lesions to identify nonresponders to standard-of-care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). In a prospective clinical study, we show the feasibility of generating and testing PDOs for evaluation of sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our PDO test predicted response of the biopsied lesion in more than 80\% of patients treated with irinotecan-based therapies without misclassifying patients who would have benefited from treatment. This correlation was specific to irinotecan-based chemotherapy, however, and the PDOs failed to predict outcome for treatment with 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin. Our data suggest that PDOs could be used to prevent cancer patients from undergoing ineffective irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
Tumor organoids from individual patients with metastatic colorectal cancer can help predict response to irinotecan with or without 5-fluorouracil.

This variability between single-cell protein levels can have regulatory roles, such as controlling cell fate during apoptosis induction or the proliferation/quiescence decision. Here, we review examples connecting protein levels and their dynamics in single cells to cellular functions. Such findings were made possible by the introduction of antibodies, and subsequently fluorescent proteins, for tracking protein levels in single cells. However, in heterogeneous cell populations, such as tumors or differentiating stem cells, cellular decisions are controlled by hundreds, even thousands of proteins acting in concert. Characterizing such complex systems demands measurements of thousands of proteins across thousands of single cells. This demand has inspired the development of new methods for single-cell protein analysis, and we discuss their trade-offs, with an emphasis on their specificity and coverage. We finish by highlighting the potential of emerging mass-spec methods to enable systems-level measurement of single-cell proteomes with unprecedented coverage and specificity. Combining such methods with methods for quantitating the transcriptomes and metabolomes of single cells will provide essential data for advancing quantitative systems biology.},

Here, we present an updated R-based pipeline for differential analyses of HDCyto data, largely based on Bioconductor packages. We computationally define cell populations using FlowSOM clustering, and facilitate an optional but reproducible strategy for manual merging of algorithm-generated clusters. Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signalling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals. Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models or linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e.g., multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e.g., plots of aggregated signals).},

The advent of mass cytometry increased the number of parameters measured at the single-cell level while decreasing the extent of crosstalk between channels relative to dye-based flow cytometry. Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts.},

	abstract = {Immune cells function in an interacting hierarchy that coordinates activities of various cell types according to genetic and environmental contexts. We developed graphical approaches to construct an extensible immune reference map from mass cytometry data of cells from different organs, incorporating landmark cell populations as flags on the map to compare cells from distinct samples. The maps recapitulated canonical cellular phenotypes and revealed reproducible, tissue-specific deviations. The approach revealed influences of genetic variation and circadian rhythms on immune system structure, enabled direct comparisons of murine and human blood cell phenotypes, and even enabled archival fluorescence-based flow cytometry data to be mapped onto the reference framework. This foundational reference map provides a working definition of systemic immune organization to which new data can be integrated to reveal deviations driven by genetics, environment, or pathology.},

	abstract = {Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies suffer from many sources of technical noise, including under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed “dropout,” which can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells), a method that shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. We validate MAGIC on several biological systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover regulatory relations without perturbations.},

\section{CyGNAL: An accessible mass cytometry analysis pipeline}

The main testament for the usefulness of the tool is the fact that it has become a part of routine mass cytometry analyses in our lab and is currently under revision at Nature Protocols. With the recent addition of plain text to FCS intercompatibility, one can seamlessly integrate with other mass cytometry platforms such as Cytobank. Additionally, as only simple Python run commands in a bash terminal are needed to run the pipeline, it has been readily adopted in day-to-day lab use even by people with no advanced computing experience. As we have shown in the methods section, CyGNAL is able to perform a comprehensive analysis, including both intensity (EMD) and connectivity (DREMI) scores, and custom interactive plots through ShinyApps (that downloaded directly from the web browser).

scRNA-seq not enough.
% The colonic organoid systems have been thoroughly characterised before at the mass cytometry level and, to better understand these systems, we aim to perform a comparative characterisation of the organoids using scRNA-seq.
Then analysis presented here was paired with mass cytometry. Interregotate regulatino and big scale to functionally understand mecahnisms driving polarisation.

% In summary, through single-cell perturbation analysis of >1,000 organoid cultures, we charted a continuous landscape of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic regulation of colonic stem cell polarisation. We found that colonic stem cell polarity is regulated by competing YAP and PI3K signalling flux, with stromal TGF-\textbeta\hspace{0.1cm} pushing epithelia towards revCSC and CRC mutations trapping epithelia as proCSC. We conclude that cell-fate plasticity is a hallmark of colonic oncogenesis, and that cells can rapidly traverse the colonic differentiation landscape via combinations of oncogenic and stromal signalling.

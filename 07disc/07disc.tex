\section{CyGNAL: An accessible mass cytometry analysis pipeline}

The main testament for the usefulness of the tool is the fact that it has become a part of routine mass cytometry analyses in our lab and is currently under revision at Nature Protocols. With the recent addition of plain text to FCS intercompatibility, one can seamlessly integrate with other mass cytometry platforms such as Cytobank. Additionally, as only simple Python run commands in a bash terminal are needed to run the pipeline, it has been readily adopted in day-to-day lab use even by people with no advanced computing experience. As we have shown in the methods section, CyGNAL is able to perform a comprehensive analysis, including both intensity (EMD) and connectivity (DREMI) scores, and custom interactive plots through ShinyApps (that downloaded directly from the web browser).

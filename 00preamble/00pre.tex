%	Self-plagiarism declaration form template for these typeset in LaTeX
%	Prepared by David Sheard 2022 and made available free of copyright

%	If you use the results of your own published, accepted or submitted data (text or figures) in your final 
%	doctoral thesis, you have to give a clear indication of the previous work, stating the exact source of the 
%	previous material, irrespective of whether copyright is owned by you or by a publisher. This indication 
%	should take the form of 
%		a) an appropriate citation of the original source in the relevant Chapter; and 
%		b) completion of the UCL Research Paper Declaration form---this should be embedded after the 
%		Acknowledgements page in the thesis.

%	For mor information consult the following links:
%	\url{https://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/guidance-on-selfplagiarism/?utm_source=Students\%27+Union+UCL\&utm_campaign=2ed9e73ab7-\&utm_medium=email\&utm_term=0_fe8c0cbcf2-2ed9e73ab7-209240456\&mc_cid=2ed9e73ab7\&mc_eid=0496c22bfc}
%	\url{https://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/guidance-on-selfplagiarism/Declaration-form_published-work-in-thesis.docx}

%	Please use this form to declare if parts of your thesis are already available in another format, 
%	e.g. if data, text, or figures:
%	•	have been uploaded to a preprint server 
%	•	are in submission to a peer-reviewed publication 
%	•	have been published in a peer-reviewed publication, e.g. journal, textbook.  

%	This form should be completed as many times as necessary. For instance, if a student had seven 
%	thesis chapters, two of which having material which had been published, they would complete this form twice.

\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
My research is about stuff.

It begins with a study of some stuff, and then some other stuff and things.

There is a 300-word limit on your abstract.
\end{abstract}

\begin{impactstatement}

	UCL theses now have to include an impact statement. \textit{(I think for REF reasons?)} The following text is the description of the guide linked from the website of submission and formatting. (Link to the guide: {\scriptsize \url{http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/docs/Impact-Statement-Guidance-Notes-for-Research-Students-and-Supervisors.pdf}})

\begin{quote}
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods or
methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
research areas.

The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or
organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
research, over many years, decades or longer.

Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
etc.

Further information including a searchable list of hundreds of examples of UCL impact outside of
academia please see \url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/}. For thousands more examples, please see
\url{http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/SelectUoa}.
